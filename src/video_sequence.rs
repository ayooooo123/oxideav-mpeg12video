//! §6.2.2 `video_sequence()` top-level decode loop with §6.1.1.11
//! display-order frame reordering, per ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262) /
//! ISO/IEC 11172-2 (MPEG-1).
//!
//! ## Where this sits
//!
//! Every per-picture reconstruction driver already exists:
//! [`crate::decode_intra_picture`] reconstructs an **I** picture,
//! [`crate::decode_inter_picture`] a frame-picture **P / B**, and
//! [`crate::decode_field_picture`] a field picture. Each takes a slice
//! region plus the already-decoded reference frame(s) and returns a
//! [`FrameBuffer`]. What was missing — and is the crate's top open gap —
//! is the loop **above** them: the §6.2.2 `video_sequence()` walker that
//!
//! 1. parses the §6.2.2.1 `sequence_header()` + §6.2.2.3
//!    `sequence_extension()` for the frame geometry
//!    ([`crate::Mpeg2Sequence`]),
//! 2. scans each §6.2.3 `picture_header()` + §6.2.3.1
//!    `picture_coding_extension()` for the `picture_coding_type`,
//!    `temporal_reference` and the f_codes / DCT-context flags,
//! 3. dispatches the picture's slice region to the matching per-picture
//!    driver — **I** → [`crate::decode_intra_picture`], **P / B** →
//!    [`crate::decode_inter_picture`] — supplying the reference frame(s)
//!    from the running anchor pair, and
//! 4. **reorders** the reconstructed frames from coded order into
//!    display order per §6.1.1.11, so the caller receives them in the
//!    order they are shown, not the order they are coded.
//!
//! ## §6.1.1.11 frame reordering
//!
//! The coded order (the order pictures appear in the bitstream, which is
//! the order the decoder reconstructs them) is **not** the display
//! order whenever B-frames are present. The spec rule, transcribed:
//!
//! * If the current coded frame is a **B**-frame, the output frame is
//!   the frame just reconstructed from that B-frame — B-frames are never
//!   delayed, they pass straight through.
//! * If the current coded frame is an **I**- or **P**-frame, the output
//!   frame is the *previously* reconstructed I- or P-frame (the held-back
//!   anchor) if one exists; if none exists (start of sequence) no frame
//!   is output yet. The newly reconstructed I/P frame becomes the new
//!   held-back anchor.
//! * At the end of the sequence the final held-back I/P anchor is
//!   flushed (output last).
//!
//! Worked example from §6.1.1.11 — coded order
//! `1I 4P 2B 3B 7P 5B 6B …` reorders to display order
//! `1I 2B 3B 4P 5B 6B …`. The driver implements exactly that mapping by
//! holding one I/P anchor back by one and emitting it when the next
//! anchor arrives (or at end of stream).
//!
//! ## Reference management (§7.6)
//!
//! A **P**-frame predicts from the most recently decoded I/P frame (the
//! forward anchor). A **B**-frame predicts from the two most recently
//! decoded I/P frames — `forward` is the older anchor (past), `backward`
//! the newer (future). Because a B-frame is coded *after* both of its
//! anchors, both are already reconstructed when the B-frame is decoded,
//! so no look-ahead is needed: the driver keeps the two latest anchors
//! (`forward_anchor`, the previous I/P; `backward_anchor`, the latest
//! I/P) and feeds them to [`crate::decode_inter_picture`].
//!
//! ## Field pictures (§6.1.1.4.1)
//!
//! When an interlaced sequence is coded as **field pictures** the loop
//! handles them too: each field picture (`picture_structure ==
//! TopField` / `BottomField`) is reconstructed into a field-height
//! buffer by [`crate::decode_field_picture`], the first field of a pair
//! is held until its partner arrives, and the two are interleaved into
//! one full-height reconstructed frame
//! ([`crate::assemble_frame_from_fields`], §3.131 top→even lines / §3.13
//! bottom→odd lines). The assembled frame then flows through the same
//! §6.1.1.11 reorder + §7.6 anchor rotation as a frame picture. The
//! §7.6.2.1 second-field-of-a-P-frame reference rule (the most-recent
//! reference field is this frame's just-decoded first field) is honoured
//! by building a synthetic reference frame that pairs the current first
//! field with the previous frame's opposite-parity field.
//!
//! The packet and whole-stream APIs share one bounded incremental parser
//! and picture state. MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, downloaded quantizer matrices,
//! field pairs and display reordering use the same reconstruction paths.
