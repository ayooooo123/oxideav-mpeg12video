//! MPEG-1 residual `dct_coeff_first` / `dct_coeff_next` run-level VLC
//! walker per **ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993 §2.4.2.8 / §2.4.3.7** with field
//! semantics from §2.4.3.7 and the Annex B **Tables B.5c / B.5d / B.5e**
//! variable-length codes plus the **Table B.5f** escape encoding.
//!
//! Round 16 landed the intra-block DC prelude (Tables B.5a / B.5b plus
//! `dct_dc_differential` → `dct_zz[0]`). Round 17 lands the wider
//! `dct_coeff_first` / `dct_coeff_next` walker that follows the DC
//! field in intra blocks and replaces the DC step entirely in non-intra
//! blocks — the residual block's run-length-coded body of zig-zag
//! coefficients.
//!
//! `dct_coeff_first` and `dct_coeff_next` share the same VLC table; the
//! only difference is the special treatment of the `1s` (2-bit) vs
//! `11s` (3-bit) codewords for `(run = 0, level = 1)`:
//!
//! * The 2-bit code `1s` is **only** used for `dct_coeff_first` (the
//!   first coefficient of a non-intra block). Using it as
//!   `dct_coeff_next` would clash with the `end_of_block` codeword
//!   `10` — both start with `1`.
//! * The 3-bit code `11s` is used for `dct_coeff_next` (the second,
//!   third, … coefficient of any block).
//! * `end_of_block` is the 2-bit code `10`, recognised by
//!   `dct_coeff_next` only. The spec forbids encoding `end_of_block`
//!   as the first coefficient of a block.
//!
//! The escape codeword `0000 01` (6 bits) is followed by a Table B.5f
//! fixed-length payload — either a 14-bit short form (6 bits of run
//! followed by 8 bits of signed level for `level ∈ [-127, +127] \ {0}`)
//! or a 22-bit long form (6 bits of run followed by a 16-bit level
//! word whose top 8 bits select sign/magnitude for
//! `level ∈ [-255, -128] ∪ [+128, +255]`).
//!
//! The reconstructed `(run, signed_level)` is the next zig-zag-ordered
//! entry the decoder writes into `dct_zz[]` per the §2.4.3.7 update
//! procedure (`i = run` for `dct_coeff_first` then `i += run + 1` for
//! each `dct_coeff_next`).
//!
//! Spec citations refer to **ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993** (MPEG-1 Video) §§
//! 2.4.2.8, 2.4.3.7, and Annex B Tables B.5c, B.5d, B.5e, B.5f. The
//! MPEG-1 escape encoding is intentionally **not** the same as MPEG-2
//! Table B-16 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 §7.2.2.3 explicitly notes the change);
//! this module implements the MPEG-1 form only.
//!
//! Bit groupings in the table constants mirror the spec's printed bit
//! strings (1- to 16-bit groups, not nibble-aligned), so an audit can
//! read each entry off the spec page directly. clippy's
//! `unusual_byte_groupings` lint prefers uniform 4-bit groups, which
//! would obscure the spec correspondence.
