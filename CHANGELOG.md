## [Unreleased]

### Changed — PearTube streaming fork

- Conceal damaged MPEG-1/2 4:2:0 I/P/B frame pictures rather than dropping
  damaged B pictures. The attributed FFmpeg 2da55bf slice, reconstruction and
  error-resilience ports retain decoded macroblocks, repair missing prediction
  and DC values, and smooth damaged edges before output/reference rotation.
- Map MPEG-2 4:2:0 chroma to the shared downloaded luma quantizer matrices.
  FATE PVA retains all 37 pictures exactly against FFmpeg `-idct simple`,
  including its cut-off B picture; damaged I/P/B TS pictures also match.
- Bound macroblock attempts across repeated slices to twice the picture grid.
  An overlong individual slice cannot expand the reconstructed picture;
  repeated coverage exceeding the work budget is rejected.
- Decode and reorder pictures during packet draining instead of retaining the
  whole elementary stream until flush. Bound compressed input, timestamps and
  picture geometry; reset all state and preserve incomplete-field EOF behavior.
- Publish validated visible geometry during `send_packet`, and keep geometry
  and pixel format attached to the exact returned frame across sequence changes.
- Use the attributed LGPL-2.1-or-later integer simple-IDCT kernel for exact
  FFmpeg `-idct simple` output; preserve field, quantizer and reference semantics.
- Replace coefficient width/table scans with immutable 8-bit primary and bounded
  second-level lookups, exhaustively checked against both normative codebooks.
- Replace encoder-byte snapshots with complete independent decoded-output
  checks; keep legacy fixtures and reference coverage. Add full-frame streaming,
  changing-geometry, leading-zero and mutation/reset regressions.
- Associate packet PTS/DTS with the first picture commencing in each packet;
  choose output times as FFmpeg `guess_correct_pts` does and fill gaps from
  exact §6.3.10 durations in the packet time base. Remove the display-index
  fallback that mixed picture counters with container timestamps.
- Packet decoding tolerates random access: pictures before a sequence header,
  P/B pictures before an anchor and open-GOP leading B-pictures are skipped,
  still applying their §6.3.11 quantiser-matrix downloads. Closed-GOP leading
  B-pictures decode backward-only in both APIs.
- Bound slice work: the walker rejects macroblock addresses outside the
  picture grid before parsing or decoding them, and picture drivers stop at the
  first slice that covers more macroblocks than the grid holds. MPEG-1 D
  pictures apply the same bound before decoding any block.
- Interpolate presentation times as exact fractions of a tick, summed over a
  common denominator in the reduced time base, with checked arithmetic. A
  duration may exceed `i64`; only a time that does not fit `i64` is an
  `InvalidData` error, never an overflow panic, wrapped value or lost fraction.
- Keep `low_delay` from the sequence extension: such pictures are output as
  decoded, at their own decode time, as in FFmpeg.
- Decode an opening I-field + P-field pair at startup or after reset when the
  P field predicts from the first field; reject predictions from missing
  fields, including the implicit zero-motion prediction of "No MC" macroblocks.
- Encoder conformance applies frame-count, source-fidelity, slice-structure and
  Annex C checks to newly encoded streams, not only to committed fixtures.

### Other

- README + CHANGELOG — round 456: interlaced 4:2:2 / 4:4:4, vertical_size > 2800, typed runtime options, the three scalable loops + encoders, arbitrary slice structures; Not-yet-supported rewritten to the remaining scalable corners

### Added

- arbitrary slice structures decode: a slice's first `macroblock_address_increment` positions it within the row against the §6.3.17.1 / ISO/IEC 11172-2 §2.4.3.6 reset instead of being rejected — several slices per row (13818-2 §6.1.2) and row-spanning, mid-row-starting slices (11172-2 §2.4.1) now decode; `encode_intra_picture_with_slice_length` / `encode_mpeg1_intra_picture_with_slice_length` emit both shapes; two black-box-validated slice-structure streams join the corpus
- §7.7 spatial scalability (progressive layers, weight table 00) — the two-layer decode loop (`decode_spatial_scalable_sequence`: §7.7.3 resampled `spat_pred_pic` per picture, Tables B-5 / B-6 / B-7 through the walker's new scalable-table plumbing, §7.7.4 class 0 / 1 / 4 prediction, §7.7.6 skips, §7.7.5.1 resets, Table 7-18 chroma upgrades, §6.3.7 non-scalable pictures) and the self-made enhancement-layer encoder (`encode_spatial_enhancement_layer`: mirrored GOP structure, per-macroblock intra / temporal / spatial-only / half-weight decision); `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()` writer; `SliceWalkContext::with_scalable_tables` + `MacroblockRecord::spatial_temporal_weight`; pinned spatial pair in the corpus (lower layer black-box validated) and a `spatial_decode` fuzz target
- §7.9 temporal scalability — the two-layer decode loop (`decode_temporal_scalable_sequence`: Table 7-28 / 7-29 reference selection from the most recent enhancement picture / most recent / next lower-layer frame resolved by multiplex position, §6.3.13 temporal-reference cross-check, no enhancement reorder) with the §6.3.7 `remultiplex`, and the self-made enhancement-layer encoder (`encode_temporal_enhancement_layer`: leading P pictures from the next lower frame, B pictures from the surrounding lower frames or the most recent enhancement picture); `picture_temporal_scalable_extension()` writer; pinned temporal pair in the corpus (lower layer black-box validated) and a `temporal_decode` fuzz target
- §7.8 SNR scalability — the two-layer decode loop (`decode_snr_scalable_sequence`: Table B-8 enhancement macroblocks, non-intra refinement blocks, §7.8.3.4 coefficient addition before saturation, one combined frame store, §7.8.2.1 `dct_type` coincidence, `F''lower = 0` for lower-layer skips) and the self-made enhancement-layer encoder (`encode_snr_enhancement_layer`) that is its oracle; `sequence_scalable_extension()` writer; `inverse_quantise_arithmetic` / `saturate_and_mismatch` split; pinned SNR pair in the corpus (lower layer black-box validated) and an `snr_decode` fuzz target
- runtime `Encoder` adapter exposes the full assembler surface through a typed option schema (`Mpeg12EncoderOptions`, `CodecOptionsStruct`): `picture_structure` (frame / field / frame_field / field_adaptive), `interlaced`, the entropy flags, `FrameEncodeOptions` (`skipped_macroblocks`, `concealment_motion_vectors`, `top_field_first`, `repeat_first_field`, `pulldown = 3:2`), `dual_prime`, Annex C `rate_control = cbr` (`bit_rate_value` / `vbv_buffer_size_value`, `bit_rate` + `frame_rate` from `CodecParameters`), §7.10 `data_partitioning` (two partition packets), `mpeg1_d_pictures`; 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 pixel formats; unknown keys and malformed values rejected at construction
- `vertical_size > 2800` end to end — the encoders emit the §6.2.4 / §6.3.16 `slice_vertical_position_extension` (`write_slice_header_in`), the frame / field decode drivers derive `mb_row` from it, and the §7.10 data-partitioning split / merge carries it in both partitions ahead of `priority_breakpoint`
- the encode round-trip fuzz target now covers field-picture pairs, frame-field pictures, every chroma format on every path and tall (> 2800-line) pictures
- four black-box-validated interlaced 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 streams join the pinned self-encoded corpus (twenty-six): 4:2:2 field pairs, 4:2:2 frame-field, 4:2:2 adaptive field modes, 4:4:4 frame-field
- 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 on the frame-picture field-based encode path — §6.1.3 field-DCT chroma organisation for the full-height chroma formats, the per-macroblock `dct_type` decision costed over every block, chroma-generic `coded_block_pattern()` emission
- 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 on the field-picture encode paths — plain and adaptive I/P/B field encoders, the field display-order assembler and the Annex C field CBR controller are chroma-format generic (Figures 6-11 / 6-12 macroblocks, §6.2.5.3 `coded_block_pattern_1` / `_2`)

- ISO/IEC 11172-2 D-picture decode (picture_coding_type 4)

### Fixed

- platform-deterministic DCT/IDCT cosine kernel — constant correctly-rounded table
- clippy findings in the field-picture encoder arc

- doc(hidden) the internal §6/§7 plumbing surface
- README reference-conformance section + MPEG-1 whole-stream decode; round-410 CHANGELOG
- whole-sequence reference-conformance corpus (8 streams, both standards)
- decode_to_yuv — dump display-order planar YCbCr for black-box comparison

### Added

- round 453: **`alternate_scan` / `intra_vlc_format` on the interlaced
  encode paths** — the field-picture encoders (plain and adaptive) and
  the `frame_pred_frame_dct = 0` frame-field encoder now honour the
  two entropy flags on the wire (Table 7-3 → Table B-15 intra AC, §7.3
  scan selection threaded through the block writers, the `dct_type`
  wire-bit cost comparison and the intra AC cost probe) instead of
  rejecting them; combined with the already-threaded `q_scale_type` /
  `intra_dc_precision` the whole picture-coding-extension entropy
  flag set is now encodable in every picture structure at 4:2:0.
- round 453: two new pinned self-encoded conformance streams
  (`tests/fixtures/selfenc/`, black-box strict-mode clean):
  `selfenc-skipconceal-64x48.m2v` (skipped macroblocks + concealment
  motion vectors) and `selfenc-fffull-64x64.m2v` (frame-field encode
  under `alternate_scan` + `intra_vlc_format` + non-linear quantiser
  + 10-bit DC) — twenty-two streams total.

### Added

- round 453: **`FrameEncodeOptions`** (`encode_options`) — optional
  behaviours for the frame-picture encoders, threaded through new
  `_with_options` / `_with_stats` variants of
  `encode_intra_picture` / `encode_p_picture` / `encode_b_picture`
  and a per-display-frame options closure on
  `encode_display_order_gop_sequence_with_options` (which also
  returns the whole-sequence `FrameEncodeStats` macroblock counts):
  - **Skipped-macroblock emission (§7.6.6)** — the P encoder skips a
    macroblock whose zero-vector frame prediction quantises to an
    all-zero residual (§7.6.6.2 reconstruction, predictors reset);
    the B encoder tries the previous macroblock's direction with the
    current PMV vectors first and skips when that residual quantises
    to zero (§7.6.6.4, predictors untouched, §7.6.3.8 span legality
    checked on the inherited vectors). The §6.3.17 restrictions are
    enforced (never the first / last macroblock of a slice, no
    I-picture skips), runs ride Table B-1 `macroblock_escape` chains
    (`mb_address_increment::encode_mb_address_increment`).
  - **Concealment motion vectors (§7.6.3.9)** — with the flag set,
    every intra macroblock (all of an I-picture's, the P encoder's
    intra fallbacks) carries a frame-format forward vector coded
    against `PMV[0][0]` plus the `marker_bit`, with the Table 7-9
    `Frame-based‡ intra` both-slot predictor write-back. Per the
    §7.6.3.9 recommendation the vector suits the macroblock *below*
    (searched against the previous anchor), `(0, 0)` on the bottom
    row. I-pictures now write a real `f_code[0][*]` when (and only
    when) the flag is set.
  - **§6.3.10 output-cadence signalling** — `top_field_first`,
    `repeat_first_field` and a `progressive_frame` override on the
    picture-coding-extension writer, validated against the §6.3.10
    consistency rules
    (`PictureCodingExtensionParams::validate_frame_picture_flags`),
    plus the `FrameEncodeOptions::pulldown_32` 3:2 pattern helper.
- round 453: **I-picture concealment-vector decode** —
  `decode_intra_picture_with_context` (`IntraDecodeContext`) walks
  I-pictures whose `picture_coding_extension()` sets
  `concealment_motion_vectors` (the walker must consume each intra
  macroblock's `motion_vectors(0)` + `marker_bit` to stay in step);
  `decode_video_sequence` now threads the flag and the forward
  f_codes from the parsed extension instead of assuming they are
  absent.
- round 453: **`DecodedFrame` display-process fields** —
  `top_field_first` / `repeat_first_field` / `progressive_frame`
  from the picture coding extension (field pairs report the
  first-coded field and `progressive_frame = 0`; MPEG-1 frames
  `progressive_frame = 1`), with the §6.3.10
  `output_field_count` / `output_frame_count` helpers.

- round 453: **§7.10 data partitioning** (`data_partitioning`) — the
  partition-switching decoding process implemented as a
  bitstream-to-bitstream engine over the crate's per-element syntax
  parsers, driven in two configurations: `split_data_partitions`
  (non-scalable ISO/IEC 13818-2 stream → partition 0 / partition 1 at
  a Table 7-30 `priority_breakpoint` of `1..=3` or `64..=127`:
  `sequence_scalable_extension()` inserted, slice-level
  `priority_breakpoint` written, partition-1 header copies filtered to
  the three §7.10-allowed extensions, per-element routing including
  the per-`(run, level)`-pair breakpoints ≥ 64 and the concealment
  `marker_bit`) and `merge_data_partitions` (the §7.10
  *"current_partition"* switch re-forming the non-scalable stream),
  with `decode_data_partitioned` chaining merge →
  `decode_video_sequence`. `merge(split(s, pb)) == s` byte-exactly for
  every `.m2v` stream of the conformance + self-encoded corpus at
  breakpoints 1 / 2 / 3 / 64 / 65 / 72 / 127 (`tests/data_partitioning.rs`);
  hostile pairs (swapped, duplicated, truncated, non-scalable, MPEG-1)
  are rejected, never panicked. §5.2.3 zero stuffing after slices is
  preserved through partition 0.
- round 453: **cargo-fuzz harness** (`fuzz/`) with three targets —
  `decode` (raw + structure-aware MPEG-1/MPEG-2 skeleton splices
  through `decode_video_sequence`, panic-freedom contract) and
  `encode_roundtrip` (fuzzer-chosen geometry / chroma / flags /
  options / pixels through the GOP assembler, decode-success +
  frame-count oracle) and `partition_merge` (attacker partition pairs
  and corrupted valid pairs through the §7.10 merge) — plus the
  scheduled `Fuzz` workflow (daily,
  30-minute budget, org reusable `crate-fuzz.yml`).

### Fixed

- round 453: **§6.1.2.2 restricted slice structure enforced** —
  `decode_video_sequence` now rejects a picture whose slices do not
  enclose every macroblock of the §6.3.3 grid exactly once (Table 8-5
  imposes the restricted slice structure on every defined profile;
  ISO/IEC 11172-2 §2.4.1 forbids gaps between slices). Found by the
  new `decode` fuzz target: a 282-byte input whose pictures carried
  no slices at all minted one full-size 4019×2549 frame per
  `picture_start_code` and ran the process past 1 GB
  (`tests/fixtures/hostile/zero-slice-pictures-282b.bin` pins the
  rejection; `tests/decoder_robustness.rs`).
- round 453: clippy 1.98 `needless_late_init` in
  `mpeg1_reconstruct` (CI toolchain drift).
- round 453: the frame-picture `picture_coding_extension()` writer
  emitted `top_field_first = 1` unconditionally — §6.3.10 requires
  `0` when `repeat_first_field` is `0` in a progressive sequence —
  and `chroma_420_type = 0` unconditionally — §6.3.10 requires it to
  equal `progressive_frame` at 4:2:0. Both header bits are now
  derived correctly (reconstruction was never affected); the ten
  pinned progressive self-encoded corpus streams were regenerated,
  their black-box reference decodes coming back byte-identical.

### Added

- round 447: **4:2:2-profile encoder leg** — the frame-picture I/P/B
  encoders, the display-order / GOP assemblers and the Annex C CBR
  controller are chroma-format generic:
  - `profile_and_level_indication` follows the chroma format
    (4:2:0 → Main@Main `0x48` unchanged; 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 → High@Main
    `0x18`, the one profile whose Table 8-5 row admits 4:2:2 chroma
    in the 1995 text — 4:4:4 has no conformant label there and reuses
    the High superset, documented) together with the §6.3.5
    `chroma_format` code.
  - Figure 6-11 **eight-block macroblocks** on the encode path (the
    interleaved Cb/Cr §7.2.1 DC chain; per-format chroma macroblock
    extents; the §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling was already shared with the
    decode-side prediction former) and the §6.2.5.3
    `coded_block_pattern()` extensions: `encode_coded_block_pattern`
    emits the Table B-9 VLC plus the two-bit `coded_block_pattern_1`
    (4:2:2, mask bit `7 - i`) / six-bit `coded_block_pattern_2`
    (4:4:4) per §6.3.17.4, with cbp 0 emitted exactly where Table
    B-9's NOTE permits (never at 4:2:0; legal at 4:2:2 when only
    extension blocks are coded). Exhaustive encode→parse→derive
    round-trips over all 255 4:2:2 patterns.
  - `tests/encode_422.rs`: intra flat-exact / structured / 100×62
    round-trips with per-row chroma-detail retention (guards any
    4:2:0 collapse of the full-height chroma), P MC-copy fixed point,
    decoder-exactness of a translated P against the encoder's
    returned reconstruction, a chroma-extension-only macroblock proof
    (cbp420 == 0 + cbp_1 != 0 observed on the wire), an I/P/B group,
    two-GOP display-order sequences, and an Annex C **CBR** 4:2:2
    stream held to `vbv::verify_cbr_stream`.
- round 447: **`intra_vlc_format` + `alternate_scan` honoured on the
  wire** — the frame-picture intra / P / B encoders previously
  declared the two flags but always coded Table B-14 in zigzag order
  (a latent stream-corruption footgun); the block writers now take
  the §7.2.2.1 Table 7-3 selection (Table B-15 for intra blocks when
  declared) and the §7.3 scan explicitly. The field-picture encoder
  gained the same explicit flags-unsupported rejection the
  frame-field encoder already had. `tests/encode_422.rs` pins the
  full flag set — Table B-15 + alternate scan + non-linear
  `q_scale_type` + 10-bit `intra_dc_precision` — on flat-exact,
  structured, GOP-with-intra-fallback and gen-2-convergence
  round-trips (strict idempotence is unattainable at
  `intra_dc_precision = 2`: the u8-rounding DC perturbation of up to
  64·0.5/8 = 4 exceeds half the `intra_dc_mult = 4` step), plus a
  10-bit-vs-8-bit DC non-inferiority proof on smooth ramps.
- round 447: **§6.3.11 downloadable quantiser-matrix emission** —
  `write_sequence_header` gained the `load_*_quantiser_matrix`
  payload slots (`SequenceHeaderParams` `Option`s, default `None`,
  all previous output byte-identical), `write_quant_matrix_extension`
  writes the §6.2.3.2 extension carrying the chroma tables (w = 2 /
  w = 3 — no sequence-header slot exists for them; 4:2:2 / 4:4:4
  only), `QuantMatrixExtension::validate_for_emission` /
  `resolved_state` mirror the parse-side §6.3.11 rules for the
  writer, and the frame-path block coders quantise + reconstruct
  against exactly the Table 7-5 bank the decoder resolves. New
  entry points `encode_intra_picture_with_matrices` /
  `encode_p_picture_with_matrices` / `encode_b_picture_with_matrices`
  / `encode_display_order_gop_sequence_with_matrices` (plain names
  delegate with defaults). `tests/encode_quant_matrices.rs` pins the
  explicit-default no-op, a coarse intra matrix moving both sides
  identically, a chroma-only download leaving luminance
  bit-identical, decoder-exactness of a 4:2:2 I P GOP under both
  chroma tables, and the emission-validation rejections.
- round 447: **4:4:4 encode leg** — intra pictures code all twelve
  Figure 6-12 blocks; non-intra macroblocks emit the six-bit
  `coded_block_pattern_2` per the **printed** §6.3.17.4 derivation,
  which drives `pattern_code[8..12]` from bits 3..0 and leaves blocks
  6 / 7 with no wire slot — the P/B encoders keep those residuals
  untransmitted (`nonintra_block_has_cbp_slot`) with the
  reconstruction in agreement, and always emit bits 5..4 as zero so
  the streams decode identically under a corrected six-block
  `i = 6..12` reading. `tests/encode_444.rs` pins intra fidelity in
  every chroma quadrant, the P fixed point, decoder-exactness, the
  transmitted right-column blocks, the dropped-but-exact bottom-left
  quadrant, and a translating GOP with the documented chroma-drift
  bound.
- round 447: **three streams join the pinned self-encoded corpus
  (now twenty)** — `selfenc-422-ibbp-64x48.m2v` (4:2:2 I B P B P;
  black-box strict pass clean, reference decode max |Δ| = 2 at 2.6 %
  samples), `selfenc-422-full-64x48.m2v` (the full flag set +
  §6.3.11 luma-and-chroma matrix downloads; strict clean, max
  |Δ| = 2 at 1.4 %), and `selfenc-444-ibp-64x48.m2v` (4:4:4 I B P;
  strict clean, max |Δ| = 1 at 2.0 %). All seventeen pre-existing
  streams regenerate byte-identical.

- round 443: **frame-picture field-based encode**
  (`frame_field_encoder`) — the `frame_pred_frame_dct = 0`
  frame-picture encode path (§6.3.17.1), the encoder-side mirror of the
  decode drivers:
  - `encode_ff_p_picture` — per macroblock the encoder scores Table
    6-17 **Frame-based** (one frame vector), **Field-based** (two
    field vectors, each with its own §6.2.5.2
    `motion_vertical_field_select` parity, found by the both-parity
    16×8 field-in-frame search `estimate_field_in_frame_mv` over
    §7.6.3.8-legal spans) and — behind the §7.6.3.6 no-B gate —
    **Dual-prime** (shared base vector + 9-combo Table B-11
    `dmvector` search over the exact §7.6.7.4 four-field-average
    prediction, all four read spans checked), keeps the
    bit-cost-biased SAD winner, and falls back to intra
    (Table B-3 `00011` + transmitted `dct_type`).
  - `encode_ff_b_picture` — six candidates (frame/field ×
    fwd/bwd/interp), Table B-4 modes, forward vectors before backward,
    per-direction PMV slots. `encode_ff_intra_picture` — every
    macroblock transmits `dct_type`.
  - **per-macroblock `dct_type` by exact wire-bit cost**: the
    luminance residual is quantised in both §6.1.3 organisations
    (frame stride 1 / field stride 2 via `block_placement`) and the
    cheaper §7.2.2 coding wins; 4:2:0 chroma stays frame-organised.
  - motion-vector coding mirrors §7.6.3.1 / §7.6.3.3 exactly against
    the crate's own `Pmv` bank: field vectors in frame pictures code
    the vertical against `PMV DIV 2` and write back `2 * vector'`;
    the Table 7-10 rows (Frame-based / Dual-prime copy `r0 → r1`,
    Field-based "(none)", intra reset) are applied per macroblock.
  - reconstruction runs through the decode-side §7.6 drivers
    (`reconstruct_inter_macroblock` /
    `reconstruct_field_based_macroblock` /
    `reconstruct_frame_dual_prime_macroblock`) fed the encoder's
    residual `f_pel` blocks, so references are the decoder's exact
    frames.
  - `encode_ff_display_order_gop_sequence` — whole interlaced
    sequences (`progressive_sequence = 0`, §6.3.3 `2*Ceil(h/32)`
    grid, GOP structure, per-GOP `temporal_reference` reset);
    dual-prime only at `b_between = 0`. `FrameFieldStats` surfaces
    the per-macroblock decisions. `tests/encode_frame_field.rs` pins
    sample-exact decodes (field-based P, mixed frame+field PMV
    interplay in one slice, field-DCT I, dual-prime P, field-based B
    with display reorder), the decisions firing on crafted interlaced
    content, and the interlaced 48-line grid.
- round 443: **adaptive field-picture encode — per-macroblock 16×8 MC
  and dual-prime** (`encode_field_p_picture_adaptive` /
  `encode_field_b_picture_adaptive` /
  `encode_field_adaptive_display_order_gop_sequence`): the Table 6-18
  `field_motion_type` surface emitted adaptively — simple field
  prediction (`01`), §7.6.7.3 **16×8 MC** (`10`, independent
  `(vector, field-select)` per 16×8 region via
  `estimate_field_region_mv`) and §7.6.3.6 **dual-prime** (`11`, one
  vector + `dmvector`, P-only, `b_between = 0`), with the full
  Table 7-11 predictor-row interplay mirrored (simple copies
  `r0 → r1`, 16×8 updates both `r` slots with no copy, dual-prime
  copies the forward pair, intra resets) and reconstruction through
  the decode-side drivers. `FieldModeStats` surfaces the decisions;
  `tests/encode_field_adaptive.rs` pins sample-exact 16×8 P / B and
  field dual-prime P decodes plus the §7.6.3.6 rejection.
- round 443: **MPEG-1 D-picture encode** (`encode_mpeg1_d_picture` /
  `encode_mpeg1_d_sequence`) — the §2.4.3.4 dc intra-coded picture
  type, the bit-exact inverse of `decode_mpeg1_d_picture`: Table B.2d
  `macroblock_type` `'1'`, six DC-only blocks per macroblock (Tables
  B.5a/B.5b prelude + differential against the exact §2.4.4.1
  `dct_dc_*_past` chain; no AC walk, no `end_of_block` per the
  §2.4.2.8 `picture_coding_type != 4` gates), the `end_of_macroblock`
  `'1'` bit, every macroblock coded (§2.4.4.4), no f_code fields in
  the picture header. The D-only sequence assembler (§2.4.1) emits
  GOP layers with per-GOP `temporal_reference` reset; coded order ==
  display order. `tests/encode_d_pictures.rs` pins sample-exact
  round-trips through both `decode_mpeg1_d_picture` and
  `decode_video_sequence`.
- round 443: **runtime encoder registry wiring** (`encoder` module) —
  `register` now installs `oxideav_core::Encoder` factories under both
  the `mpeg1video` and `mpeg2video` codec ids beside the decoders
  (direct `encoder::make_encoder` factory kept per the dual-API
  convention). `Mpeg12Encoder` adapts the display-order GOP
  assemblers to the frame-to-packet contract, mirroring the runtime
  decoder's whole-elementary-stream framing: buffered display-order
  frames are assembled at `flush()` into one keyframe-flagged packet
  (`NeedMore` before the flush, `Eof` after the drain); four
  range-validated options (`quantiser_scale_code`, `b_between`,
  `anchors_per_gop`, `f_code`). `tests/runtime_encoder.rs` pins
  registry resolution, round-trips through both decode paths, the
  11172-2 classification of the `mpeg1video` output, and
  option/geometry/lifecycle guards.
- round 443: **four streams join the pinned self-encoded corpus**
  (now seventeen): `selfenc-framefield-64x64.m2v` (interlaced
  frame-picture I B P B P, Field-based macroblocks + field DCT —
  black-box validated, strict pass clean, max |Δ| = 2),
  `selfenc-dualprime-64x64.m2v` (I P P mixing Frame/Field/Dual-prime
  macroblocks — strict pass clean, max |Δ| = 1),
  `selfenc-fieldmodes-64x64.m2v` (field-coded I P P mixing simple /
  16×8 / dual-prime macroblocks in the same slices — default decode
  max |Δ| = 1; the strict pass flags field-pair packets while
  decoding every frame, as with the other field-coded fixtures), and
  `selfenc-mpeg1-dpics-48x32.m1v` (MPEG-1 D-only sequence — **no**
  black-box reference exists: the reference binary emits zero frames
  for `picture_coding_type == 4`, so it is pinned bit-exactly and
  decoded sample-exactly against the encoder's own reconstruction).
  All thirteen pre-existing streams regenerate byte-identical.

- round 440: **exact Annex C Video Buffering Verifier** (`vbv`) — the
  shared ISO/IEC 13818-2 Annex C (C.1–C.12) / ISO/IEC 11172-2 Annex C
  (C.1.1–C.1.4) constant-bit-rate buffer model:
  - `VbvCbrModel` — the C.3.1 / C.1.3 CBR state machine in exact
    integer arithmetic (time sub-units of
    `1 / (180 000 * frame_rate_numerator)` s, so the 1001-denominator
    Table 6-4 rates, frame/field removal cadences and 90 kHz
    `vbv_delay` ticks are all representable without rounding — Annex C
    prescribes real-valued arithmetic): §6.3.9 / §2.4.3.4
    `vbv_delay = 90 000 * B*(n) / R` computation, the C.5 / C.1.4
    overflow and C.6 underflow checks at every removal, and encoder
    planning bounds (`max_end_bits` for the underflow limit,
    `min_end_bits` for the stuffing threshold before the next
    examination).
  - `verify_cbr_stream` — a whole-elementary-stream Annex C verifier:
    parses the declared `bit_rate` / `vbv_buffer_size` / frame rate
    (MPEG-1 header semantics or the MPEG-2 extension upper bits),
    groups start codes into the C.5 / C.1.4 "picture data" spans
    (preceding headers + picture + trailing stuffing, terminating
    `sequence_end_code` included), seeds the model from picture 0's
    coded `vbv_delay`, and holds every picture to the overflow /
    underflow bounds and a C.3.1-consistent coded `vbv_delay`
    (±1 tick of quantisation), with frame pictures on the C.9 / C.11
    frame-period cadence and field pictures on the C.11 field-period
    cadence (`repeat_first_field = 0` scope).
  - `frame_rate_value` (the Table 6-4 / §2.4.3.2 rational rate table)
    and `patch_vbv_delay` (in-place rewrite of the §6.2.3 / §2.4.3.4
    16-bit field inside a finished picture layer).
- round 440: **MPEG-2 CBR rate control** (`rate_control` /
  `encode_cbr_gop_sequence`) — the VBV-regulated display-order GOP
  assembler: the sequence header declares `bit_rate_value` /
  `vbv_buffer_size_value` and the emitted stream *satisfies* them
  against the exact Annex C model. The controller re-encodes a picture
  at a coarser `quantiser_scale_code` while it exceeds the C.6
  underflow bound, appends §5.2.3 zero-byte stuffing when a picture
  undershoots the C.5 overflow bound for the next examination, steers
  per-type (I/P/B) quantisers by a soft per-GOP bit-budget feedback
  loop, and stamps the real C.3.1 / §6.3.9
  `vbv_delay = 90 000 * B*(n) / R` into every picture header (never
  the `0xFFFF` variable-rate sentinel). `tests/encode_cbr_roundtrip.rs`
  pins: `verify_cbr_stream` conformance of the emitted streams
  (occupancy bounds + delay consistency), decode round-trips with
  bounded distortion, quantiser adaptation under rate pressure,
  stuffing on near-flat content, single-frame / clamped-tail edge
  cases, and rejection of unrepresentable configurations (`vbv_delay`
  range, content that cannot fit the rate at `quantiser_scale_code`
  31).
- round 440: **MPEG-1 CBR rate control** (`encode_mpeg1_cbr_sequence`)
  — the ISO/IEC 11172-2 mirror: the same VBV-regulated GOP assembly
  under the 11172-2 Annex C (C.1.1–C.1.4) model (removal every
  §2.4.3.2 nominal picture interval), real §2.4.3.4 `vbv_delay` in
  every picture header ("for constant bitrate operation, the
  vbv_delay is used to set the initial occupancy of the decoder's
  buffer"), §2.3 zero-byte stuffing before start codes against the
  overflow bound, quantiser-coarsening re-encode against the
  underflow bound, rejection of the `0x3FFFF` variable-bit-rate code,
  and the §2.4.3.2 `constrained_parameters_flag` evaluated exactly as
  in the plain assembler. `tests/encode_mpeg1_cbr_roundtrip.rs` pins
  `verify_cbr_stream` conformance (MPEG-1 header semantics), decode
  round-trips, adaptation, stuffing, and VBR/impossible-config
  rejection.
- round 440: **MPEG-2 field-picture inter encode**
  (`field_picture_encoder`) — the encoder-side mirror of the crate's
  §7.6.1 field-picture decode path (*"within a field picture all
  predictions are field predictions"*):
  - `encode_field_intra_picture` / `encode_field_p_picture` /
    `encode_field_b_picture` — per-field-picture encoders emitting
    `picture_structure` = Top/Bottom (Table 6-14) with the §6.3.10
    field-picture constants (`top_field_first = 0`,
    `repeat_first_field = 0`, `frame_pred_frame_dct = 0`,
    `progressive_frame = 0`; new
    `stream_writer::write_field_picture_coding_extension`),
    `field_motion_type = 01` (Table 6-18 Field-based, no `dct_type`
    per §6.2.5.1), the §6.2.5.2 `motion_vertical_field_select` flag,
    and motion vectors coded directly in field-sample units against
    the §7.6.3.4 PMV (§7.6.3.3 Table 7-9 both-slot copy). P pictures
    carry the Table B-3 modes + intra fallback; B pictures the Table
    B-4 forward/backward/interpolated modes with per-direction PMV
    slots and field selects.
  - `estimate_field_mv` — both-parity field motion search scoring
    each `(reference field, vector)` candidate by the SAD of the
    exact §7.6.4 field prediction, restricted to §7.6.3.8-legal spans
    within the chosen reference field.
  - `encode_field_display_order_gop_sequence` — whole-sequence
    assembly as §6.1.1.4.1 field-picture pairs (top field first, both
    fields sharing the frame's `temporal_reference`): interlaced
    sequence declaration (`progressive_sequence = 0`), GOP structure
    as the frame assembler, and the **§7.6.2.1
    second-field-of-a-P-frame reference rule** via the same synthetic
    reference frame the decode loop builds
    (`second_p_field_reference`).
  - Reconstruction is decoder-exact (the shared
    `predict_field_picture_macroblock_planes` + residual add), pinned
    by `tests/encode_field_pictures.rs`: per-picture sample-exact
    decode-vs-encoder-reconstruction for I/P/B field pictures through
    `decode_field_picture`, a cross-parity prediction proof (a
    one-frame-line shift is predicted through the opposite-parity
    reference field at a fraction of intra cost), whole-sequence
    decode through `decode_video_sequence`, and geometry rejection
    (height % 32, progressive-sequence exclusion §6.3.5). Black-box
    cross-check: the reference decoder's default decode of an
    encoded I/P/B field sequence agrees with ours at max |Δ| = 1
    (its strict mode flags field-pair packets while decoding them —
    the same documented behaviour as the fieldpics conformance
    fixture).
- round 440: **CBR rate control over field-coded sequences**
  (`encode_field_cbr_gop_sequence`) — the field assembler under Annex
  C VBV regulation: every field picture is its own VBV picture removed
  at the **C.11 field-period cadence** (`t(n+1) − t(n) = T`, `T` the
  inverse of twice the frame rate; the second field of a P/I frame
  follows at `2*T − T = T`), with its own real §6.3.9 `vbv_delay`,
  quantiser decision, and C.5 stuffing; the whole-stream verifier
  reads each picture's `picture_structure` and applies the matching
  cadence. Pinned in `tests/encode_cbr_roundtrip.rs` (12 field
  pictures verify + decode to 6 assembled frames).
- round 440: **a field-coded stream joins the pinned self-encoded
  corpus** (`selfenc-fieldseq-48x64.m2v`): an I B P B P sequence coded
  entirely as §6.1.1.4.1 field pairs (fields 48×32,
  `motion_vertical_field_select` over both parities, §7.6.2.1
  second-P-field reference, Table B-4 B-field modes) — black-box
  default decode agrees with ours at max |Δ| = 1, pinned bit-exactly
  by `tests/selfenc_conformance.rs` (the reference binary's strict
  mode flags field-pair packets while decoding them, the same
  documented behaviour as the `fieldpics-48x64` conformance fixture).
- round 440: **two CBR streams join the pinned self-encoded corpus**
  (`tests/fixtures/selfenc/`): `selfenc-cbr-64x48.m2v` (MPEG-2
  I B P B P | I B P at 240 kbit/s, 65 536-bit VBV) and
  `selfenc-mpeg1-cbr-64x48.m1v` (MPEG-1 two-GOP I B B P at the same
  rate/buffer, constrained-parameters flag set) — both black-box
  validated (strict error-detection pass clean, committed reference
  decodes within the corpus |Δ| ≤ 3 contract), pinned bit-exactly by
  `tests/selfenc_conformance.rs`, and additionally held to the full
  Annex C occupancy / `vbv_delay`-consistency verification against
  the declared `bit_rate` / `vbv_buffer_size`.
- round 416: **conformant ISO/IEC 11172-2 (MPEG-1) encode path**
  (`mpeg1_encoder`) — the bit-exact inverse of the crate's §2.4
  decode pipeline:
  - `mpeg1_stream_writer::write_mpeg1_sequence_header` (§2.4.2.3
    header with MPEG-1 field semantics and **no**
    `sequence_extension()` — its absence is the 11172-2
    classification) + `constrained_parameters_admissible` evaluating
    the §2.4.3.2 bounds (768×576, 396 MBs, MB×rate ≤ 396·25,
    rate ≤ 30, f_codes ≤ 4, 1 856 000 bit/s, 327 680-bit VBV) so the
    assembler sets `constrained_parameters_flag` exactly when they
    hold.
  - MPEG-1 entropy encoders: `block_dc::encode_dc_coefficient`
    (Tables B.5a/B.5b DC prelude, exhaustive `[-255, 255]`
    round-trip), `dct_coeff::encode_dct_coeff` /
    `encode_end_of_block` (Tables B.5c–B.5e VLCs with the `(0, ±1)`
    FIRST/NEXT two-form rule + the Table B.5f short/long escape,
    exhaustive run 0..=63 × |level| 1..=255 round-trip), and the
    §2.4.4.1 round-to-nearest / §2.4.4.2 dead-zone forward
    quantisers (`forward_quant::mpeg1_forward_quantise_intra_ac` /
    `mpeg1_forward_quantise_non_intra`, `quantizer_scale` used
    directly, ±255 clamp).
  - Picture encoders `encode_mpeg1_intra_picture` (§2.4.2.8 DC
    differentials against the exact §2.4.4.1 `dct_dc_*_past` chain
    incl. the `past_intra_address` reset branch, every macroblock
    coded per §2.4.4.4), `encode_mpeg1_p_picture` (Table B.2b
    `MC Coded` / `MC Not Coded` / intra-fallback modes, §2.4.4.2
    `recon_*_prev` differential MVs with slice-start + after-intra
    resets, real 3-bit picture-header f_code, `full_pel = 0`), and
    `encode_mpeg1_b_picture` (Table B.2c forward/backward/
    interpolated modes, per-direction §2.4.4.3 predictors updated
    only on transmission) — each reconstructing through the
    decoder's own dequantiser + Annex A IDCT so decodes are
    sample-exact against the encoder's returned frames.
  - `encode_mpeg1_display_order_sequence` /
    `encode_mpeg1_intra_stream` — whole display-order assembly with
    the **mandatory §2.4.2.4 GOP layer**: per-GOP §2.4.3.3 time
    codes, `closed_gop = 1` (no B ever predicts across a GOP
    boundary in the emitted structure), `broken_link = 0`, per-GOP
    `temporal_reference` reset (§2.4.3.4), anchors every
    `b_between + 1` display frames with the final frame always an
    anchor, D-picture-free.
- round 416: **GOP header emission** —
  `gop_header::write_gop_header` (the §6.2.2.6 / §2.4.2.4 writer,
  byte-exact against the existing parser) and
  `TimeCode::from_display_index` (+ `nominal_pictures_per_second`,
  the Table 6-4 / §2.4.3.2 rate table under the `drop_frame = 0`
  nearest-integral-rate counting rule), plus the MPEG-2
  `encode_display_order_gop_sequence` assembler: one I-picture per
  GOP, per-GOP time codes, closed GOPs, and the §6.3.9 per-GOP
  `temporal_reference` reset.
- round 416: **MPEG-1 `full_pel_*_vector = 1` emission** —
  `mpeg1_stream_writer::write_mpeg1_picture_header` (the §2.4.2.5
  picture header with per-direction full-pel flag control) and
  `full_pel_forward` / `full_pel_backward` parameters on
  `encode_mpeg1_p_picture` / `encode_mpeg1_b_picture`: vectors are
  confined to integer-pel positions and the wire (and predictor
  pair) carries the unshifted values the §2.4.4.2 / §2.4.4.3 final
  `recon <<= 1` restores. Round-trip test pins the header flags and
  the sample-exact decode; a full-pel stream passes the black-box
  strict decode clean.
- round 416: **downloadable §2.4.3.2 quantiser matrices in the
  MPEG-1 encoder** — `Mpeg1SequenceParams` carries optional
  `intra_quant_matrix` / `non_intra_quant_matrix` zigzag payloads;
  `write_mpeg1_sequence_header` emits the `load_*_quantizer_matrix`
  flags + payloads (returning `Result` and enforcing the no-zero-byte
  and `intra_quant[0][0] == 8` rules), and the assembler threads the
  loaded matrices into both the forward quantiser and the returned
  reconstructions (the decoder derives the same matrices from the
  header, so decodes stay sample-exact).
- round 416: **self-encoded corpus extended to ten streams** —
  `selfenc-mpeg1-intra-64x48.m1v`, `selfenc-mpeg1-ippp-64x48.m1v`,
  `selfenc-mpeg1-ibbp2gop-64x48.m1v`, `selfenc-mpeg1-qmat-48x32.m1v`
  (downloadable quantiser matrices), and `selfenc-gops-48x32.m2v`
  (MPEG-2 GOP structure), each black-box validated (strict
  error-detection clean; committed reference decodes agree with ours
  at max |Δ| = 2, ≤ 1.7 % samples differing) and pinned bit-exactly
  by `tests/selfenc_conformance.rs`; the five pre-existing MPEG-2
  fixtures regenerate byte-identical (no encoder bit drift).

### Fixed

- round 443: **platform-deterministic DCT/IDCT cosine kernel** — the
  §A cosine table was built at runtime with `f64::cos()`, whose
  final-ulp rounding differs between platform math libraries, making
  the **encoder's emitted bits host-dependent** whenever a quantised
  coefficient landed on a rounding boundary (CI regenerated two
  pinned corpus streams with different bytes on Linux/Windows). The
  kernel is now the constant `idct::COS_TABLE` — the eight
  `cos(kπ/16)` magnitudes as correctly-rounded `f64` constants —
  shared by the forward DCT and the IDCT, so all transform arithmetic
  uses exactly-rounded IEEE operations only. Thirteen corpus streams
  regenerate byte-identical under the constant kernel; four moved by
  boundary flips and were regenerated + re-black-box-validated
  (max |Δ| = 1 against the committed reference decodes).

### Changed

- Internal §6 syntax-walker / §7 reconstruction / encoder-stage plumbing
  (49 modules plus the internal items and crate-root re-exports of the
  mixed modules) is now `#[doc(hidden)]`: the documented / semver-checked
  surface is the whole-stream decode entry points, the encoder entry
  points, the registry glue, and the frame/error types their signatures
  expose. No item was removed or changed — hidden paths keep working.

### Added

- round 413: **ISO/IEC 11172-2 D-picture decode** (dc intra-coded,
  `picture_coding_type == 4`, §2.4.3.4) — `PictureCodingType::DcIntra`
  (bare header parse accepts it, no f_code fields; the MPEG-2 chained
  parser rejects it per Table 6-12 "shall not be used"),
  `mpeg1_block_decoder::decode_d_block` (§2.4.2.8 DC-prelude-only
  block: no AC walk, no `end_of_block`),
  `mpeg1_picture::decode_mpeg1_d_picture` (Table B.2d 1-bit
  `macroblock_type`, six DC-only blocks, `end_of_macroblock` '1' bit,
  §2.4.4.1 `dct_dc_*_past` chain, §2.4.4.4 no-skips rule), and
  `decode_video_sequence` routing (D-pictures display in coded order,
  never referenced — §2.4.1 D-only sequences). Table B.2d added to
  the `macroblock_type` table family. Pinned hand-built fixture
  `tests/fixtures/conformance/mpeg1-dpics-48x32.m1v`
  (`examples/gen_d_conformance.rs`, SHA-256 in the corpus README)
  decoded sample-exactly against closed-form §2.4.4.1 arithmetic —
  no external reference exists: the black-box decoder refuses
  type-4 pictures (zero frames out).
- round 413: **§6.3.11 downloadable quantiser matrices threaded
  through the whole-stream decoder** — `decode_video_sequence` now
  carries a running `QuantiserMatrixState`: reset to the §6.3.7
  defaults at every `sequence_header_code`, overwritten by the
  sequence header's own `load_*_quantiser_matrix` payloads (routed
  through `QuantMatrixExtension::apply` so the §6.3.11
  both-luma-and-chroma composition is shared), and updated by every
  `quant_matrix_extension()` found between a picture's
  `picture_coding_extension()` and its first slice. New
  `decode_intra_picture_with_matrices` /
  `decode_inter_picture_with_matrices` /
  `decode_field_picture_with_matrices` driver variants chain the
  state into the slice walker (the plain names remain as
  default-matrix shorthands). Conformance: new black-box fixture
  `mpeg2-qmat-96x64.m2v` (custom intra + non-intra matrices loaded
  via the sequence header) decodes reference-conformant (max |delta|
  2, 1.8% samples); `tests/quant_matrix_threading.rs` proves the
  extension path exactly with self-encoded spliced streams —
  default-matrix download is a byte-identical no-op, a doubled-AC
  matrix changes the reconstruction, the download persists to the
  next picture, and a repeat sequence header resets to defaults.
- round 413: **§6.3.3 interlaced macroblock-grid alignment**
  (the r410 non-multiple-of-32 height followup) —
  `IntraPictureParams` gains `progressive_sequence` and its
  `mb_height()` now implements the §6.3.3 rule: `Ceil(h/16)` rows
  progressive, `2*Ceil(h/32)` rows for an interlaced sequence's frame
  pictures. Reconstruction storage follows the coded grid
  (`FrameBuffer::with_mb_grid` / `IntraPictureParams::new_frame_buffer`),
  so an interlaced 48-line picture retains its fourth macroblock row
  (lines 48..63) as legal §7.6.4 reference material instead of
  clipping it. `assemble_frame_from_fields` now allocates the frame
  as twice the field-plane storage so both fields' macroblock-grid
  overhang rows survive the interleave (and `extract_field` recovers
  them for the §7.6.2.1 second-field synthetic reference);
  `field_geometry` uses `Ceil(h/2)` for the field height. The
  encoders now declare `progressive_sequence = 1` (+ §6.3.10
  `progressive_frame = 1`), matching the `Ceil(h/16)` grid they
  actually code — previously they emitted interlaced declarations
  with a progressive grid, non-conforming at heights not multiples
  of 32. New corpus fixture `mpeg2-ilaced48hm-96x48.m2v`
  (high-motion interlaced, 4-row grid on a 48-line picture) decodes
  reference-conformant (max |delta| 2).
- round 413: **`encode_display_order_sequence`** — whole
  display-order sequence assembler with the classic `I (B..) P (B..)
  P ..` group structure: anchors every `b_between + 1` display
  positions (final anchor clamped to the last frame — B-pictures
  cannot trail the sequence), §6.1.1.11 coded-order emission,
  per-display-index `temporal_reference`, and every anchor predicted
  from the decoder's exact reconstruction. Fifth corpus stream
  `selfenc-ibbp-64x48.m2v` (I B B P B B P, 7 frames) decodes in the
  black-box reference decoder at max |delta| 1 on every frame.
- round 413: **Encoder external conformance + pinned self-encoded
  corpus** (`tests/fixtures/selfenc/` + `tests/selfenc_conformance.rs`
  + `examples/gen_selfenc_corpus.rs`) — four deterministic
  self-encoded streams (all-intra 64x48, all-intra non-mb-multiple
  100x62, I+3P motion-compensated chain with intra fallback, I/B/P
  group) each decoded by the black-box reference decoder (strict
  error-detection mode clean) with the committed `.ref.yuv` agreeing
  with our own decode at max |delta| 2 / <= 2.1% samples. The test
  pins the encoder bit-exactly (regenerate-and-compare) and holds the
  decode to the corpus |delta| <= 3 / < 5% contract plus a bounded
  round-trip luma MAE against the synthetic inputs.
- round 410: **Whole-sequence reference-conformance corpus**
  (`tests/fixtures/conformance/` + `tests/reference_conformance.rs`) —
  nine elementary streams (three MPEG-1: IBBP, high-motion wide-f_code,
  VCD-rate CBR SIF; six MPEG-2: IBBP adaptive-quant, interlaced
  field-prediction, intra_vlc/non-linear-quant/10-bit-DC, 4:2:2
  profile, non-macroblock-multiple 100x62, and a hand-built
  field-picture stream) paired with black-box reference decodes.
  Every stream decodes whole-sequence reference-conformant: exact
  frame count/dimensions, |delta| <= 3 per sample (Annex A IDCT
  rounding freedom; empirically <= 2 everywhere but one sample), < 5%
  differing samples per frame. Fixture notes record every generation
  command and SHA-256.
- round 410: **MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2) whole-stream decode** —
  `decode_video_sequence` now classifies the sequence layer (no
  `sequence_extension` -> 11172-2) and decodes MPEG-1 I/P/B pictures
  end-to-end: new `mpeg1_block_decoder` (§2.4.3.7 coefficient walk +
  §2.4.4.1/.2 dequantisation + Annex A IDCT), an MPEG-1 block branch
  in the slice walker carrying the `dct_dc_*_past`/`past_intra_address`
  chain, and `mpeg1_picture` picture drivers implementing the
  §2.4.4.2/.3 `recon_*_prev` predictor lifecycle, §2.4.4.4 skips and
  `full_pel_*_vector` scaling, with sequence-header quantiser matrices
  threaded (zigzag -> raster).
- round 410: **Hand-built field-picture oracle fixture + generator**
  (`examples/gen_field_conformance.rs`) — I/P/B field pairs with both
  `motion_vertical_field_select` parities (incl. §7.6.2.1 same-frame
  second-field references), §7.6.3.6 dual prime, §7.6.7.3 16x8 MC and
  an interpolated B-field pair; the black-box reference decode agrees
  with ours within ±1 everywhere.
- round 410: **`decode_to_yuv` example** — dump a stream's
  display-order frames as packed planar YCbCr for byte-comparison
  against any reference decoder's rawvideo output.
- round 410: **Types-aware display-order verification**
  (`display_indices_from_coded_pictures` /
  `verify_display_order_with_types`) — GOP boundaries detected by the
  anchor pattern (a new GOP begins at an anchor whose
  `temporal_reference` is <= the previous anchor's), classifying a GOP
  whose leading I-frame has `temporal_reference > 0` correctly where
  the trefs-only heuristic mis-bases it.

### Fixed

- round 413: **P/B picture headers now carry the §6.3.10 legacy
  `forward_f_code` / `backward_f_code` value '111'** — the MPEG-1
  compatibility fields in `picture_header()` "shall have the value
  seven (all ones)" in an ISO/IEC 13818-2 stream (the real f_codes
  live in the picture_coding_extension); the P/B encoders were
  writing the actual f_code there. Self-encoded corpus refreshed
  (reference decodes unchanged — conforming decoders ignore the
  legacy fields).
- round 413: **Motion search emitted §7.6.3.8-illegal vectors at
  right/bottom edge macroblocks** — `estimate_forward_mv` scored
  candidates through the padding `predict_block`, so a vector whose
  §7.6.4 sample span crossed the coded-picture boundary could win at
  edge macroblocks (translating content pushed the true motion off
  the edge). The reference decoder flagged every such macroblock
  ("motion vector out of boundary") and refused the prediction —
  first P frame ~50% wrong in the black-box decode while our own
  padding decoder mirrored the encoder and hid it. The search now
  visits only vectors whose full §7.6.4 read span (including the
  half-sample interpolation neighbour) stays inside the reference
  plane.
- round 410: **§7.2.1 DC predictors now reset on skipped macroblocks**
  — an intra macroblock following a skip run after another intra
  macroblock decoded its `dct_dc_differential` against a stale
  predictor (spurious "QFS[0] outside the §7.2.1 range" on real
  adaptive-quantisation streams).
- round 410: **4:2:2 / 4:4:4 chroma block numbering** — Figures
  6-11/6-12 interleave the chroma blocks (Cb even indices, Cr odd) and
  walk each component column-major; `block_component` had two
  contiguous runs and `block_placement` tiled 4:4:4 row-major, so every
  4:2:2/4:4:4 macroblock swapped half its chroma blocks between
  components.
- round 410: **Macroblock-aligned reconstruction storage** —
  reconstructed frames were clipped to the visible dimensions,
  discarding bottom/right edge-macroblock overhang samples that later
  §7.6.4 motion vectors may legally reference. `FrameBuffer` planes now
  cover the full macroblock grid; display consumers crop via
  `Plane::packed_rect` / `FrameBuffer::visible_chroma_dims`.
- round 410: **Slice at end-of-stream with a short non-zero tail keeps
  decoding** (§6.2.4/§5.2.3) — a stream ending right after its last
  slice with no `sequence_end_code` left the final macroblocks encoded
  in fewer than 23 trailing bits; the walker declared end-of-slice and
  the bottom macroblock row reconstructed as zeros. Truncated stop
  peeks are now evaluated with zero extension.
- round 410: **Frame-picture field-based prediction honours
  `motion_vertical_field_select`** (§7.6.4) — each vector now reads the
  reference field its own flag names (the destination field's parity
  was used before), with chroma following its luminance vector's
  selected field.
- round 410: **§7.6.6.4 B-frame-picture skips take their vectors from
  the motion vector predictors** — the previous macroblock contributes
  only the prediction direction; the vectors come from `PMV[0][s]` at
  the skip position (which differs after a field-based macroblock).
- round 410: **§2.4.4.2 wrap-seam guard made asymmetric** — the spec
  forbids only `little == +16f`; `-16f` is a legal vector value real
  CBR streams emit (motion_code -16 with a zero complement).
- round 410: **I field pictures walk with the field structure** —
  §6.2.5.1 gates `dct_type` on `picture_structure == "Frame picture"`;
  routing an I field through the frame-structure intra driver consumed
  a spurious bit per intra macroblock and sheared the slice parse.

### Added (earlier rounds)

- round 398: **Decoder robustness harness** (`tests/decoder_robustness.rs`)
  — proves the runtime `Decoder` never panics on malformed input: every
  header-region byte truncation plus a coarse whole-stream truncation
  sweep, single-byte bit-flips strided across the fixture, empty input,
  a bare sequence-header prefix, and deterministic pseudo-random bytes
  salted with valid-looking start codes (alone and behind a real
  sequence header). Each input is driven through the full
  `send_packet` / `flush` / `receive_frame` lifecycle; all surface a
  clean error or empty output, none unwind. Also documents the current
  MPEG-1 whole-stream coverage in the `decoder` module: both codec ids
  route through `decode_video_sequence`, which requires the MPEG-2
  extension family, so a pure ISO/IEC 11172-2 stream surfaces a clean
  parse error until the MPEG-1 picture driver lands.
- round 398: **Runtime `oxideav_core::Decoder` wiring + registry
  registration** (`decoder` module). `register` is no longer a no-op:
  it installs decoder factories under both `"mpeg1video"` and
  `"mpeg2video"` (with the `mp1v`/`mpg1`/`mp2v`/`mpg2`/`hdv2`/`m2v1`
  FourCC + `V_MPEG1`/`V_MPEG2` Matroska tags the container crates map
  onto these ids). `Mpeg12Decoder` adapts the whole-elementary-stream
  driver `decode_video_sequence` to the packet-based `Decoder` contract:
  it concatenates every packet's payload into one contiguous
  elementary-stream buffer (the §6.1.1.11 display reorder spans the whole
  sequence, so a B-picture cannot commit until its trailing anchor is
  decoded), runs the driver at `flush()`, and drains the reconstructed
  frames in display order — returning `NeedMore` before the flush and
  `Eof` once drained. Each `FrameBuffer` converts to a tightly-packed
  planar Y/Cb/Cr `VideoFrame` (`frame_buffer_to_video_frame`) stamped
  with a monotonic display-order index; `reset()` returns the decoder to
  a fresh state. Direct factory endpoint `decoder::make_decoder` and the
  registry path (`oxideav_core::register!`) are both exposed.
  `tests/runtime_decoder.rs` proves the trait output is **sample-exact**
  with `decode_video_sequence` on the real 352×240 4:2:0 fixture and a
  split-packet feed, that both codec ids resolve through a
  `RuntimeContext`, and that `reset` makes the decoder reusable.

- round 381: **Intra-macroblock fallback in P-pictures** — the P-encoder
  now codes a macroblock intra (Table B-3 `00011`) when the motion search
  fails to predict it (the inter SAD far exceeds the macroblock's own
  intra activity), as for newly-revealed content. The intra path runs the
  §7.2.1 DC prelude + §7.2.2 AC blocks with a running DC predictor that
  resets at slice start and whenever the §6.3.17.1 `past_intra_address`
  gate (`mb_address - past_intra_address > 1`) fires — exactly matching
  the decoder's reset. An intra macroblock also resets the §7.6.3.4 motion
  predictors. `tests/encode_inter_roundtrip.rs` encodes a P target with a
  high-contrast checker region the flat ramp anchor cannot predict and
  confirms the region reconstructs with bounded error (a pure inter copy
  would be wildly off), proving the intra fallback fires and round-trips.
- round 381: **Multi-picture P-chain assembler (`encode_i_p_chain`)** —
  an I anchor followed by N predictive pictures, each predicting from the
  **reconstruction of the previous picture** (the frame the decoder
  holds), so every P's reconstruction becomes the next P's forward anchor
  exactly as the decoder rotates its anchors. Validates the
  reference-chaining across a whole GOP. `tests/encode_inter_roundtrip.rs`
  encodes an I + three P pictures tracking a sliding feature and confirms
  all four decode in coded == display order with bounded per-P error.
  Re-exported at the crate root.
- round 381: **Bidirectional B-picture encoder (`b_picture_encoder`)** —
  forward / backward / interpolated motion-compensated prediction.
  `encode_b_picture` predicts each macroblock from two reconstructed
  anchors (the past forward reference and the future backward reference),
  running a motion search in both directions, scoring the three §7.6.7
  prediction modes by luma SAD and keeping the cheapest, then coding the
  residual with the shared `p_picture_encoder` block path. The Table B-4
  macroblock type (`Fwd`/`Bwd`/`Interp` × `Coded`/`Not Coded`) is emitted
  with forward vectors before backward vectors; each direction keeps its
  own §7.6.3.4 PMV slot (reset at slice start, updated only when that
  direction is present). `encode_i_p_b` assembles a complete three-frame
  I→P→B stream in coded order (display order I-B-P, `temporal_reference`
  0-1-2): the P is coded against the decoded I and the B against the
  decoded I (forward) plus the P reconstruction (backward), so every
  reference is the decoder's exact frame. `tests/encode_inter_roundtrip.rs`
  decodes the stream into three frames in display order with correct
  temporal references and a bounded B-frame reconstruction error. The
  P-encoder's `InterBlock` / `quantise_inter_block` / `wrap_delta` /
  `write_inter_block_coeffs` are now `pub(crate)` and shared by both inter
  encoders. `encode_b_picture` + `encode_i_p_b` re-exported at the crate
  root.
- round 381: **Motion-compensated P-picture encoder (`p_picture_encoder`)**
  — the first non-trivial inter encode. `encode_p_picture` writes a full
  predictive frame picture (`frame_pred_frame_dct = 1`, one forward
  vector per macroblock): for each macroblock it runs the
  `motion_estimation` search against the reconstructed reference, forms
  the exact §7.6.4 prediction via
  `inter_reconstruction::predict_frame_macroblock_planes`, builds the
  `current - prediction` residual per block, forward-DCTs + dead-zone
  non-intra quantises it, and chooses the Table B-3 macroblock type
  (`MC, Coded` `1` when any block is coded, else `MC, Not Coded` `001`).
  Motion vectors are differentially coded against the §7.6.3.4 PMV
  (reset at slice start, updated to each coded vector) with a `wrap_delta`
  that maps `vector' - PMV` into the §7.6.3.1 codable band so the
  decoder's wrap inverts it exactly. The encoder reconstructs every
  macroblock the way the decoder will (inverse-quantise + IDCT +
  `Saturate(residual + prediction)`) and returns that reconstruction so
  it can chain as the next reference. `encode_i_then_p` assembles a
  complete I→P stream, decoding the I anchor to recover the **decoder's**
  reference so encoder and decoder share an identical anchor and the
  round-trip is bit-exact. `tests/encode_inter_roundtrip.rs` proves: a
  target equal to the decoded anchor reproduces it sample-for-sample
  (the MC-copy fixed point); a pure 4-pel translation reconstructs the
  interior with luma MAE < 4; a modified target reconstructs with bounded
  error; and non-multiple-of-16 dimensions round-trip with full coverage.
  `encode_p_picture` + `encode_i_then_p` re-exported at the crate root.
- round 381: **Motion estimation (`motion_estimation`)** — the
  encoder-side forward-MV search a P-picture macroblock uses to choose
  its motion vector. Neither MPEG video standard specifies the search
  (only how a decoder *uses* a transmitted vector), so this is an
  integer-pel full search over a `±range` luma window followed by a
  half-pel refinement, scoring every candidate by the SAD of the exact
  `forming_predictions::predict_block` prediction the decoder will form.
  `estimate_forward_mv` returns a half-sample `MotionVectorPel` plus its
  luma SAD; a small Manhattan tie-break biases equal-SAD candidates
  toward the cheaper-to-code (smaller) vector. `max_search_range` clamps
  the window so every reachable vector stays inside the §7.6.3.1
  `[low, high]` codable band of an `f_code`. Re-exported at the crate
  root. Unit tests cover zero-vector recovery on identical frames,
  exact recovery of a pure integer translation, and half-pel preference
  on a half-sample-shifted ramp.
- round 377: **MPEG-2 video encoder — intra + zero-MV inter paths**. The
  encoder is built as the bit-exact inverse of the decode pipeline so
  everything it emits round-trips through `decode_video_sequence`.
  Forward DCT (`forward_dct::fdct_8x8`, the §A transpose of the IDCT
  kernel, with `f64` reference + separable layers); forward quantiser
  (`forward_quant::forward_quantise_block`) inverting §7.4.2.3
  (round-to-nearest intra AC, dead-zone non-intra, `Round(F/intra_dc_mult)`
  intra DC); entropy encoders against the same Annex B tables the decoder
  walks (`mpeg2_block_dc::encode_intra_dc` §7.2.1 DC VLC;
  `mpeg2_dct_coeff::encode_dct_coeff` / `encode_end_of_block` §7.2.2
  run-level + Table B-16 escape with the §7.2.2.2 NOTE 2/3 FIRST/NEXT
  gating; `coded_block_pattern::encode_cbp420` §6.2.5.3 Table B-9;
  `motion_vector::encode_motion_vector` / `split_delta` §6.2.5.2.1 Tables
  B-10/B-11 inverting §7.6.3.1); §6.2 bitstream layer writers
  (`stream_writer`); `encode_intra_picture` (a complete all-intra
  frame-picture encoder, sequence header → sequence-end code);
  `encode_nonintra_block` + `encode_p_copy_picture` /
  `encode_i_then_p_copy` (the inter residual block encoder and a zero-MV
  P-picture assembler). `tests/encode_intra_roundtrip.rs` proves a flat
  frame round-trips exactly, a gradient round-trips with luma MAE < 4,
  the encoder is reconstruction-idempotent (decode→re-encode→decode is a
  pixel-exact fixed point), and the I→P-copy stream reproduces the
  decoded anchor sample-for-sample. All new entry points re-exported at
  the crate root. Motion estimation (non-zero MV search) and B-picture
  encoding remain future work; their MV-coding / residual / cbp
  primitives are already in place.
- round 373: **`temporal_reference`-driven display-order verification
  (§6.1.1.11 / §6.3.8 / §6.3.9)**.
  `display_indices_from_temporal_references` walks a coded-order list of
  `temporal_reference` values and assigns each frame a globally-monotonic
  continuous display index, accumulating a per-GOP base across the §6.3.9
  *"set to zero"* GOP reset (so frames are comparable across GOPs and
  across the modulo-1024 wrap). `verify_display_order` cross-checks that a
  display-ordered frame sequence is strictly increasing in those indices —
  i.e. that the structural §6.1.1.11 hold-back reorder agrees with the
  `temporal_reference`-implied presentation order — matching display
  frames to the smallest unconsumed coded frame of the same
  `temporal_reference` so cross-GOP duplicates pair up in order. An
  integration test asserts the two reorders agree on a decoded I-P-B run.
  Both re-exported at the crate root. Makes `temporal_reference`
  load-bearing for the display-order reorder rather than purely
  structural.
- round 373: **§7.9 temporal-scalability reference-frame selection
  (`PictureTemporalScalableExtension::resolve_references`)**. Resolves the
  `reference_select_code` into the named prediction reference source(s)
  for each picture type — Table 7-28 for P-pictures (forward = most-recent
  enhancement / most-recent lower / next lower) and Table 7-29 for
  B-pictures (the three allowed forward/backward pairs, backward always a
  lower-layer frame per §7.9). I-pictures resolve to `Intra` (no
  references). The forbidden codes (`'11'` for P, `'00'` for B) are
  rejected. New public `PictureReferences` / `ReferenceSource` enums
  re-exported at the crate root. Completes the §7.9 reference-selection
  half of the temporal-scalability enhancement-layer path (the parse +
  picture-type validation were already present).
- round 373: **§7.8.3.4 SNR-scalability addition of coefficients from
  two layers** (`snr_coefficient_addition`). `add_layer_block` forms
  `F'' = F''lower + F''enhance` for luminance / non-simulcast blocks;
  `add_layer_chroma_simulcast` implements the `chroma_simulcast == 1`
  special case (DC predicted from the lower layer, AC taken entirely from
  the enhancement layer); `simulcast_dc_predictor_block` resolves
  Table 7-27 — the lower-layer chrominance block index whose DC predicts
  a given enhancement chrominance block for each allowed `(base, upper)`
  chroma-format pair (4:2:0→4:2:2, 4:2:0→4:4:4, 4:2:2→4:4:4, and the
  identity same-format case). The §7.8.2.2 enhancement-skipped
  (`F''enhance == 0`) and lower-skipped (`F''lower == 0`) cases need no
  special path — the all-zero block flows through. New public
  `add_layer_block` / `add_layer_chroma_simulcast` /
  `simulcast_dc_predictor_block` / `CoeffBlock` re-exported at the crate
  root. Adds the SNR-scalability §7.8 combination half of the
  enhancement-layer combiner named in the README.
- round 373: **§7.7.4 co-located spatial extraction +
  per-macroblock spatial/temporal combiner**. `extract_colocated_spatial`
  reads a macroblock-sized region from a `SpatialPredictionPicture`
  component plane at the macroblock's `(base_x, base_y)` pixel position
  (the §7.7.4 *"appropriate samples, co-located with the current
  macroblock position, from spat_pred_pic"* step), with §7.7.3.5/.6
  pad-to-edge border extension for macroblocks running off the picture
  edge and a `[0, 255]` clamp. `combine_macroblock_spatial_temporal`
  composes that extraction with the existing `combine_spatial_temporal`,
  blending a macroblock's temporal prediction (`pel_pred_temp`, §7.6) with
  the co-located spatial prediction under a resolved Table 7-21
  `SpatialTemporalWeight` (single `(a)` or per-field `(a; b)` form). Both
  re-exported at the crate root; `ResamplePlane::get_clamped` is now
  public. This closes the per-macroblock side of the §7.7.4 combiner loop
  (extract → weight → blend), leaving only the full enhancement-layer
  decode loop that walks the macroblocks and feeds the temporal
  predictions in.
- round 373: **§7.7.3 picture-level spatial-prediction driver
  (`spatial_prediction_picture`)**. Composes the per-component §7.7.3.1
  `upsample_spatial_prediction` driver across a whole picture: derives the
  luminance + chrominance `ResampleParams` (Tables 7-16 / 7-17 / 7-18)
  from the parsed `sequence_scalable_extension()`
  `SpatialScalabilityParams` and the
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()` offsets/flags + the two layers'
  chrominance formats (§7.7.3.3), selects the Table 7-15 upsampling case
  once for the whole picture, and runs the deinterlace → resample →
  reinterlace stages over the lower-layer reconstructed frame's Y / Cb /
  Cr planes to emit the enhancement-grid `SpatialPredictionPicture`
  (`spat_pred_pic` per component) that the §7.7.4 combiner consumes. The
  chrominance output extent follows the **enhancement** layer's
  `chroma_shift`; negative `lower_layer_*_offset` cropping is rejected
  (documented limitation). Closes the README "deriving the Table 7-16
  `ResampleParams` from the sequence/picture geometry" gap for spatial
  scalability. New public `spatial_prediction_picture` /
  `SpatialPredictionPicture` re-exported at the crate root.
- round 370: **field-picture pair → frame assembly in the
  `video_sequence()` decode loop (§6.1.1.4.1)**. The top-level driver now
  handles field-picture sequences end-to-end: a field picture
  (`picture_structure == TopField` / `BottomField`) is reconstructed by
  `decode_field_picture` into a field-height buffer, the first field of a
  §6.1.1.4.1 coded-frame pair is held until its partner arrives, and the
  two are interleaved into one full-height reconstructed frame by the new
  public `assemble_frame_from_fields` (§3.131 top field → even frame
  lines / §3.13 bottom field → odd frame lines, applied per colour
  plane). The assembled frame then flows through the existing §6.1.1.11
  reorder + §7.6 anchor rotation exactly as a frame picture. The §7.6.2.1
  second-field-of-a-P-frame reference rule (Figures 7-7 / 7-8 — the
  most-recent reference field is *this frame's just-decoded first field*)
  is honoured by synthesising the reference frame so it carries the
  current first field in its own parity slot and the previous
  reconstructed frame's opposite-parity field in the other. Both field
  pictures of a coded frame share their §6.3.10 `temporal_reference`, and
  the frame's I/P/B reorder class follows the first field. Replaces the
  previous `Error::NotImplemented` field-picture rejection in
  `decode_video_sequence`. `assemble_frame_from_fields` is re-exported at
  the crate root. Tests: three `frame_assembly` unit tests (even/odd
  interleave, chroma-plane interleave, mismatched-field rejection) + two
  `video_sequence_decode` integration tests (field-pair → one frame; lone
  unpaired field emits no frame); the former
  `rejects_field_picture_structure` test is rewritten to the field-pair
  assembly path. Four further `video_sequence` unit tests pin the
  §7.6.2.1 synthetic-reference plumbing directly: `extract_field`
  even/odd recovery, the second-P-field reference pairing for a top first
  field and for a bottom first field, and the `field_geometry`
  half-height / forced-field-DCT derivation. A further
  `video_sequence_decode` integration test decodes an **I field-pair
  anchor followed by a P field-pair** end-to-end, driving the §7.6.2.1
  synthetic-reference path (the P bottom second field resolving its
  top-reference-field read to the just-decoded P top field of the same
  coded frame) through the real bitstream. A final
  `video_sequence_decode` test decodes a full **I/P/B field-pair run**
  (coded I·P·B, displayed I·B·P) — completing the field-pair coverage
  matrix and confirming the §6.1.1.11 display-order reorder applies
  identically whether the pictures are frame pictures or field pairs.
- round 365: **top-level `video_sequence()` decode loop with §6.1.1.11
  display-order frame reordering** — the crate's #1 open gap, the driver
  *above* the per-picture reconstructors. New `video_sequence` module
  (`decode_video_sequence(stream) -> Vec<DecodedFrame>`, `DecodedFrame`,
  both re-exported at the crate root). It parses the §6.2.2.1
  `sequence_header()` + §6.2.2.3 `sequence_extension()` once for the
  geometry (`Mpeg2Sequence`), then walks every `picture_start_code`
  (`0x00000100`): for each it parses the §6.2.3 `picture_header()` +
  §6.2.3.1 `picture_coding_extension()` (`Mpeg2PictureHeader::`
  `parse_with_extension`), overlays the per-picture §6.2.3.1 DCT-context
  flags onto the sequence geometry, and dispatches the picture region to
  the matching per-picture driver — **I** → `decode_intra_picture`,
  frame-picture **P / B** → `decode_inter_picture` — supplying the
  reference frame(s) from the running §7.6 anchor pair (`forward_anchor`
  = previous I/P, `backward_anchor` = latest I/P; a P reads the latest, a
  B reads both). The reconstructed frames are reordered from coded order
  into **display order** per §6.1.1.11: a B-frame emits immediately; an
  I/P frame displays the previously held-back anchor (held one back) and
  becomes the new held anchor; the final anchor is flushed at end of
  stream — exactly the §6.1.1.11 worked-example mapping
  (`1I 4P 2B 3B 7P 5B 6B` → `1I 2B 3B 4P 5B 6B`). The picture-region
  scan includes the boundary start code's bytes so the per-picture slice
  walkers find their §5.2.3 23-zero terminator. Frame pictures only:
  a field-picture structure (`picture_structure != Frame`) surfaces
  `Error::NotImplemented`; a P/B before its anchor exists is rejected as
  `InvalidBitstream` (§6.1.1.11 *"the first coded frame after a sequence
  header shall not be a B-frame"*). 5 new `video_sequence` unit tests
  (the §6.1.1.11 reorder truth table incl. the worked example, the
  no-B-frame pass-through, the missing-sequence-header + boundary-scan
  guards) + 5 new `tests/video_sequence_decode.rs` integration tests that
  decode a full hand-built I/P/B elementary stream end-to-end (display
  order + reference-based prediction: the P copies the I anchor, the B
  averages I and P) plus the real 352×240 fixture's single-I-picture
  sequence. Spec: ISO/IEC 13818-2 §6.1.1.11 / §6.2.2 / §6.2.3 / §7.6.
  The loop is **sequence-aware** (§6.1.1.6): it re-reads the geometry at
  every repeat / new `sequence_header()` encountered before a picture
  (`find_picture_or_sequence_start_code` dispatches a sequence header to
  a geometry re-parse, a picture to reconstruction), so a multi-GOP /
  multi-sequence stream tracks geometry changes mid-stream while the
  §6.1.1.11 reorder + §7.6 anchors carry across the repeat header (the
  next coded I/P anchor flushes the held one normally). New
  `tests/video_sequence_decode.rs` test decoding two I-pictures separated
  by a repeat `sequence_header()` + `sequence_extension()`. A further test
  decodes a **4:2:2** I-picture (8 blocks per macroblock, full-height
  chroma) end-to-end, confirming the loop threads the
  `sequence_extension()` `chroma_format` through to the per-picture
  driver and the assembled frame carries the correct 8×16 chroma planes.

- round 359: **dual-prime motion compensation** (§7.6.3.6 / §7.6.7.4,
  Table 7-13 / 7-14 `Dual prime` rows) — driven end-to-end for **both**
  picture structures, plus the **field-picture B-field skipped-macroblock**
  §7.6.6.3 direction inheritance. The §7.6.3.6 opposite-parity vector
  derivation (`dual_prime::derive_all`, Tables 7-12 `m` / 7-13 `e` + the
  inline `dmvector[0..1]`) feeds two new
  `inter_reconstruction` MC drivers:
  - `reconstruct_field_picture_dual_prime_macroblock` (+
    `predict_field_picture_dual_prime_macroblock_planes`,
    `FieldPictureDualPrimeMotion`) — forms a same-parity prediction from
    the decoded `vector'[0][0]` and an opposite-parity prediction from the
    derived `vector'[2][0]`, averaged per §7.6.7.4 `// 2`; full-extent
    field-picture chroma.
  - `reconstruct_frame_dual_prime_macroblock` (+
    `predict_frame_dual_prime_macroblock_planes`, `FrameDualPrimeMotion`)
    — forms the four field predictions (top field from top ref `vector'[0]`
    + bottom ref `vector'[2]`; bottom field from bottom ref `vector'[0]` +
    top ref `vector'[3]`), averages each field, and interleaves the two
    into the frame at stride 2; `top_field_first` selects the Table 7-12
    frame row.

  `picture_reconstruction::PicturePredictionParams` gains a
  `top_field_first` field (+ `with_top_field_first`); `decode_inter_picture`
  / `decode_field_picture` now dispatch a `DualPrime` macroblock to the new
  drivers (forward-only P-pictures), with
  `frame_dual_prime_motion_from_reconstructed` /
  `field_picture_dual_prime_motion_from_reconstructed` building the motion
  from the reconstructed + wire records. `reconstruct_skipped_field_macroblock`
  now reconstructs a §7.6.6.3 B-field skip by inheriting the previous coded
  macroblock's direction + vectors and forcing the same-parity reference
  field (state threaded per slice). 16×8-MC stays field-picture-only per the
  §7.6 *"16x8 motion compensation shall only be used with field pictures"*
  constraint — there is no frame-picture 16×8 path. 8 new
  `inter_reconstruction` unit tests (field/frame same-/opposite-parity
  averaging, distinct-opposite-vector field divergence, geometry errors,
  residual add) + 3 new integration tests (`tests/field_picture_decode.rs`
  field-picture dual-prime + B-field skip inheritance;
  `tests/inter_picture_decode.rs` frame-picture dual-prime four-field
  interleave) decode hand-built `Dual prime` slices through the full §6.2.5
  parse + §7.6.3 + §7.6.4 pipeline. All §7.6 prediction modes are now driven
  end-to-end.

- round 358: **field-picture 16×8 motion compensation** (§7.6.7.3,
  Table 7-13 `16x8 MC` rows) — the macroblock-level prediction /
  reconstruction primitive. New
  `inter_reconstruction::reconstruct_field_picture_16x8_macroblock` (+
  `predict_field_picture_16x8_macroblock_planes`,
  `FieldPicture16x8Motion`): 16×8 MC forms two separate predictions per
  macroblock — `vector'[0]` predicts the upper 16×8 luminance region,
  `vector'[1]` the lower — each carrying its own §6.3.17.2
  `motion_vertical_field_select` flag so each region reads from its own
  chosen reference field (§7.6.4 NOTE). Chroma regions are the full
  component width × half its height per §7.6.7.3 (4:2:0 → 8×4, 4:2:2 →
  8×8, 4:4:4 → 16×8); §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling, §7.6.7.2 `// 2`
  bidirectional average, and §6.1.3 contiguous field-plane write-out
  (no frame/field DCT distinction inside a field picture). 9 new unit
  tests (region/field independence, distinct per-region vectors, chroma
  region split, bidirectional average, geometry/reference errors,
  residual add). **Driven end-to-end**: `picture_reconstruction::`
  `decode_field_picture` now dispatches a `SixteenByEight`
  field-picture macroblock to the new endpoint, building the
  `[upper, lower]` region pair from the two reconstructed §7.6.3 vectors
  and their per-entry `motion_vertical_field_select` flags
  (`field_picture_16x8_motion_from_reconstructed`); only field-picture
  dual-prime stays `UnsupportedPredictionMode`. 2 new integration tests
  in `tests/field_picture_decode.rs` (independent-field regions; a
  distinct half-pel lower-region vector) decode a hand-built `16x8 MC`
  field-picture slice through the full §6.2.5 parse + §7.6.3 + §7.6.4
  pipeline.

- round 351: **field-picture simple field prediction** (§7.6.1 *"within
  a field picture all predictions are field predictions"*, Table 7-13
  `Field-based` rows) — driven end-to-end. New
  `inter_reconstruction::reconstruct_field_picture_macroblock` (+
  `predict_field_picture_macroblock_planes`, `FieldPictureMotion`):
  a field-picture macroblock is a single 16×16 field block read from
  **one** reference field selected by the §6.3.17.2
  `motion_vertical_field_select` flag (Top when `0`, Bottom when `1`,
  §7.6.4) via the §7.6.4 `FieldReference` view; per-direction
  `(luma vector, FieldParity)`, §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling, §7.6.7.2 `// 2`
  bidirectional average, and §6.1.3 contiguous field-plane write-out
  (no frame/field DCT distinction inside a field picture). New top-level
  `picture_reconstruction::decode_field_picture` driver walks a field
  picture's slices with `PictureStructure::TopField` / `BottomField`
  (selecting `field_motion_type` + the field-select bit through the
  §6.2.5 parse), reconstructs the §7.6.3 vectors, pairs each with its
  field-select flag (`field_picture_motion_from_reconstructed`), and
  reconstructs Field-based macroblocks + §7.6.6.2 P-field skips (a
  `(0,0)` same-parity-field copy); 16×8-MC / dual-prime / B-field skip
  inheritance stay `UnsupportedPredictionMode`. 6 new unit tests +
  5 new `tests/field_picture_decode.rs` fixtures decoding synthetic
  field-picture slices end-to-end (parity selection, bottom-field
  select reading odd reference rows, bottom field picture, half-pel
  field-line average, 3-MB picture with skip). Spec: ISO/IEC 13818-2
  §7.6.1 / §7.6.3 / §7.6.4 / §7.6.5 (Table 7-13) / §7.6.6.2 / §6.1.3.
- round 346: **frame-picture field-based prediction** (Table 7-14
  `Field-based` rows) — the next interlaced-decode milestone after the
  frame-based P/B driver. New `forming_predictions::FieldReference`: a
  half-height field view over a frame-organised `ReferencePlane` (field
  line `k` → frame row `2k + parity`) with `predict_field_sample` /
  `predict_field_block` running the unmodified §7.6.4 half-pel
  interpolation against a single reference field — vertical pad-to-edge
  stays inside the field's own lines. New
  `inter_reconstruction::reconstruct_field_based_macroblock` (+
  `predict_field_based_macroblock_planes`, `FieldBasedMotion`): the
  top-field luminance vector predicts the macroblock's even (top-field)
  frame lines from the top reference field, the bottom-field vector its
  odd lines from the bottom field, the two directions combine per
  §7.6.7.2, chroma uses the per-field §7.6.3.7-scaled vectors, and the
  per-field prediction plane is returned in frame-row order so the
  residual-add / §6.1.3 block placement reuse the frame-based write-out
  path (4:2:0 chroma field-splits its 8 lines into 4+4). `decode_inter_picture`
  now drives field-based macroblocks (the §7.6.3 top/bottom field vector
  pair via `field_based_motion_from_reconstructed`) instead of rejecting
  them; 16×8-MC and dual-prime stay `UnsupportedPredictionMode`. 13 new
  unit tests + 2 end-to-end synthetic field-based P-picture integration
  tests.
- round 343: picture-level **P/B reconstruction driver** — the §7.6
  motion-compensated reconstruction wired end-to-end so a P- or
  B-picture reconstructs to real pixels. New `inter_reconstruction`
  module: `reconstruct_inter_macroblock` forms a frame-based
  macroblock's per-component prediction plane (§7.6.4 pel reader over
  the reference `FrameBuffer`, §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling, §7.6.7.1 `// 2`
  bidirectional average), adds the §A IDCT residual for each coded
  block (§6.3.17.4 `pattern_code[]`), and writes the §7.6.8
  `d = saturate(f + p)` result into the frame with the §6.1.3
  frame/field DCT line organisation. New `picture_reconstruction`
  module: `decode_inter_picture` scans each slice, walks it with block
  decoding enabled, reconstructs its motion vectors
  (`reconstruct_slice_motion_vectors`), and dispatches each macroblock
  to the intra placement or the inter MC driver, handling §7.6.6
  skipped macroblocks (P `(0,0)` forward, B inherited direction). The
  MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2) reconstructed `recon_right`/`recon_down`
  vectors bridge into the same MC core (`MotionVectorPel::from_mpeg1`,
  `FrameMotion::from_mpeg1`). `slice_macroblock_walk` now resolves the
  §6.3.17.1 / Table 6-19 effective prediction type before the §7.6.3.3
  `update_predictors` call so an absent `frame_motion_type` tail
  (`frame_pred_frame_dct == 1`) no longer trips the update guard.
  `frame_assembly::Plane::put_sample` is now public. 20 new unit tests
  + 4 end-to-end synthetic P/B picture-decode integration tests.
- round 336: §7.7.3.1 / Table 7-15 upsampling-case dispatch in
  `spatial_resampling` — `UpsampleCase::select(field_select,
  lower_layer_progressive, progressive_frame)` resolves the five Table
  7-15 rows (interlaced→progressive top/bottom field, progressive frame
  ×2, interlaced→interlaced both fields) including the two *"shall have
  the value '1'"* `lower_layer_deinterlaced_field_select` constraints
  (rejected as `InvalidBitstream`), and `upsample_spatial_prediction`
  composes the existing §7.7.3.4 `deinterlace` → §7.7.3.5/.6
  `resample_progressive` → §7.7.3.7 `reinterlace` stages per the selected
  row to form `spat_pred_pic` for one component. This wires the
  previously-standalone spatial-resampling primitives into a single
  flag-driven entry point feeding the §7.7.4 spatial/temporal combiner.
  12 new unit tests (the full Table 7-15 truth table, both constraint
  rejections, and per-case driver-composition equivalence).
- round 331: §7.7.3.4 deinterlace + §7.7.3.7 reinterlace filters in
  `spatial_resampling`, completing the interlaced front/back of the
  §7.7.3 spatial-prediction pipeline that brackets the existing
  §7.7.3.5/.6 resampling. `deinterlace` builds the progressive `prog_pic`
  from an interlaced lower-layer reconstructed frame (top field = even
  rows, bottom field = odd rows) by zero-padding each field onto a
  field-rate progressive grid and applying the Table 7-19 vertical /
  temporal FIR: the two-field aperture (separate first-/second-field tap
  sets, temporal span `{-1, 0, +1}` reading the opposite field for the
  `±1` taps) for luminance in a Frame-Picture, and the one-field aperture
  (temporal `0` only) for chrominance and field-picture luminance. The
  `sum` is `sum // 16`-scaled — using a new signed `//` helper since the
  Table 7-19 `-1` / `-2` taps make `sum` possibly negative — and
  saturated to `[0, 255]`, with the §7.7.3.4 same-field
  nearest-neighbour border extension for taps outside `[0, ll_v_size)`.
  `reinterlace` forms `spat_pred_pic` from `hor_pic`: a straight copy for
  a progressive lower layer, or the field-select demultiplex (even lines
  for a top field, odd lines for a bottom field) for an interlaced one.
  New public surface: `deinterlace`, `reinterlace`, `Field`
  (re-exported as `ResampleField`).
- round 325: §7.7.3.5 / §7.7.3.6 spatial-scalable lower-layer resampling
  in a new `spatial_resampling` module — the linear-interpolation
  upsampling that takes a progressive lower-layer frame (`prog_pic`) and
  resamples it onto the enhancement-layer sample grid, producing the
  `pel_pred_spat` input the already-landed §7.7.4 combiner consumes.
  `vertical_resample` implements §7.7.3.5 (`vert_pic[yh+ll_v_offset][x] =
  (16-phase)*prog_pic[y1][x] + phase*prog_pic[y2][x]`, deferring its
  normalisation so it carries the ×16 scale); `horizontal_resample`
  implements §7.7.3.6 with the single `// 256` that folds both stages'
  ×16 scaling; `resample_progressive` composes the two for the
  progressive-to-progressive case (Table 7-15 row 3, no §7.7.3.4
  deinterlace / §7.7.3.7 reinterlace), where `hor_pic` is `spat_pred_pic`
  directly. The phase / `y1` / `y2` / `x1` / `x2` index math uses the
  §4.1 `/` (truncate toward zero) and `//` (round half away from zero,
  here non-negative so `(s + d/2) / d`) operators; out-of-frame reads use
  border extension (pad-to-edge clamp). `ResampleParams::luminance` /
  `ResampleParams::chrominance` derive the Table 7-16 local variables
  (`ll_*_size`, `ll_*_offset`, the four `*_subs_*` factors) from the raw
  `sequence_scalable_extension()` /
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()` fields, applying the Table 7-17
  `chroma_ratio` and Table 7-18 `format_ratio` adjustments for chroma. A
  `Plane` (`i32` row-major) carries the input / ×16 intermediate.
  Thirteen unit tests cover the 1:1 identity, vertical / horizontal /
  full 2× midpoint blends, border extension past the frame edge, the
  Table 7-16/7-17/7-18 chroma-ratio derivations (4:2:0→4:2:0 and
  4:2:0→4:4:4), the §4.1 `//` rounding examples, the unlisted-pair
  rejection, and the zero-size / zero-factor / mismatched-plane guards.
  All exported at the crate root (`ResamplePlane`, `ResampleParams`,
  `vertical_resample`, `horizontal_resample`, `resample_progressive`).
- round 320: §7.6.3 slice-level motion-vector reconstruction driver
  `reconstruct_slice_motion_vectors` in `slice_macroblock_walk` — the
  "walker → PMV state" wiring that composes the per-record
  `reconstruct_record_motion_vectors` endpoint into a full per-slice
  pass. It carries the §7.6.3 predictor bank (`PMV[r][s][t]`) across
  every macroblock of a parsed `SliceWalk`: §7.6.3.4 reset at slice
  start, §7.6.3.1 reconstruction per coded macroblock (accumulating the
  differential vectors across MBs), the §7.6.3.3 `update_predictors`
  table row after each one, and the §7.6.6 skipped-macroblock PMV
  side-effect (a P-picture reset, a B-picture no-op) for the
  `address_increment - 1` skipped slots that precede each coded MB. New
  `SliceMotionRecord` (per-coded-MB log: skipped-run count, whether the
  skip reset PMV, the reconstructed vectors, and the §7.6.3.3 update
  outcome) and `SliceMotionWalk` (the record list plus the final
  running `Pmv`), both re-exported at the crate root. Four unit tests
  cover the +1 → +2 cross-MB accumulation with the `NonIntraCopyForward`
  update row, the per-call §7.6.3.4 slice-start reset, the P-picture
  skipped-MB reset that breaks accumulation, and the §7.6.6 rejection of
  a skip in a non-scalable I-picture.
- round 315: §7.7.4 "Selection and combination of spatial and temporal
  predictions" — the *"precise method for predictor calculation"* in a
  new `spatial_temporal_combine` module that blends the temporal
  enhancement-layer prediction (`pel_pred_temp`) with the spatial
  lower-layer prediction (`pel_pred_spat`) under the Table 7-21
  `spatial_temporal_weight`. New `SpatialWeight` enum
  (`Temporal`/`Half`/`Spatial` for the only legal weights `{0, 0.5, 1}`)
  with `from_sixteenths()` mapping the `SpatialTemporalWeight`
  sixteenths (`0`/`8`/`16`) and `combine_sample()` implementing the
  page-115 per-sample formulae (`weight 0` → temporal,
  `weight 1` → spatial, `weight 0.5` → `(temp+spat)//2` with the §4.1
  away-from-zero rounding, identical to the §7.6.7 `avg2`). Block-level
  endpoints (all re-exported at the crate root): `combine_uniform` (the
  single `(a)` whole-block form, `table_index == '00'`),
  `combine_field_interleaved` (the per-field `(a; b)` form — `top_weight`
  to even rows / `bottom_weight` to odd rows, also the
  `progressive_frame == 0` interlaced-chroma case), and the
  `combine_spatial_temporal` driver keyed off
  `SpatialTemporalWeight::is_single`. Length / width / multiple-of-width
  geometry mismatches and out-of-table weights are rejected as
  `InvalidBitstream`. 21 unit tests incl. an exhaustive 256×256
  half-weight cross-check and Table-7-21-row reconstructions.
- round 310: §7.6.5 "Motion vector selection" (Tables 7-13 field
  pictures / 7-14 frame pictures) in a new `motion_vector_selection`
  module — the table driver that sits between §7.6.3 motion-vector
  reconstruction and the §7.6.4 pel reader, naming *which*
  reconstructed `vector'[r][s]` each prediction uses, *which reference*
  it is formed from, and *which region* of the 16×16 macroblock it
  covers. `select_predictions(&MacroblockPrediction) ->
  Result<Vec<PredictionOp>>` returns the ordered op list in bitstream
  order (the table NOTE) keyed off `picture_structure` +
  `prediction_type` (`field_motion_type`/`frame_motion_type`) + the
  three §6.3.17.1 flags. New types (all re-exported at the crate root):
  `PredictionOp` (`vector_index` r / `direction` s / `reference` /
  `region`), `ReferenceTarget` (`Frame` / `WholeField(parity)` /
  `DualPrimeSameParity(parity)` / `DualPrimeOppositeParity(parity)` —
  the latter two name the §7.6.3.6 derived vectors `vector'[2][0]` /
  `vector'[3][0]`), `PredictionRegion` (`Whole` 16×16 / `Upper16x8` /
  `Lower16x8`, with `luma_block_size()` → `BlockSize` and
  `luma_top_offset()` → 0/8), and `MacroblockPrediction` (the parsed
  inputs incl. the two `motion_vertical_field_select` parities §7.6.4
  needs in field pictures). Covers every Table 7-13 / 7-14 row:
  Frame-based (frame), Field-based (frame: first vector → top field,
  second → bottom; field: whole field from the selected parity), 16x8
  MC (field: upper/lower 16×8 with independent field selects),
  Dual-Prime (field: 2 same/opposite-parity ops; frame: 4 ops), and
  the §7.6.3.9 intra-concealment single-forward op. Rejects (via
  `Error::InvalidBitstream` with §7.6.5-named messages) the three
  malformed-descriptor cases: intra without
  `concealment_motion_vectors`, dual-prime with backward motion, and
  the no-motion-flags §7.6.3.5 implicit-zero (skipped) case that
  belongs to `skipped_macroblock`. Forms no samples, reconstructs no
  vectors, runs no §7.6.3.6 dual-prime derivation, and applies no
  §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling — it is the pure table glue between the
  already-landed endpoints. 18 new bit-exact unit tests (890 lib
  total, was 872): the region geometry pair, the Table 7-14 frame rows
  (Frame-based fwd/bwd/bidirectional, Field-based top-then-bottom and
  the 4-op bidirectional shape), the Table 7-13 field rows
  (Field-based field-select, 16x8 independent selects + 4-op
  bidirectional order), all three dual-prime shapes (field top/bottom,
  frame 4-op), the two intra-concealment arms (frame/field), and the
  three rejection paths.
- round 308: §7.7.5.1 "Resetting motion vector predictors" — the
  spatial-scalability extension to the §7.6.3.4 PMV reset rules, as a
  new `pmv::apply_spatial_temporal_reset(pmv, picture_coding_type,
  spatial_temporal_weight_class)` (re-exported at the crate root). The
  spec adds two reset cases on top of §7.6.3.4: a P-picture or
  B-picture macroblock that is purely spatially predicted
  (`spatial_temporal_weight_class == 4`, signalled by the scalable
  `macroblock_type` Tables B-5/B-6/B-7) carries no motion vector, so
  the running PMV state must be zeroed exactly as `Pmv::reset` does.
  The helper returns `true` when the reset fired (P/B + class 4),
  `false` otherwise (leaving the PMV untouched), so a macroblock-loop
  driver can label the side-effect. Intra pictures (not listed by
  §7.7.5.1) and classes `0..=3` (temporal-only or combined) take the
  no-reset path. 5 new bit-exact unit tests (872 lib total, was 867):
  the P/B class-4 reset, the intra-picture skip, the classes-0..3
  no-reset sweep across P and B, and an out-of-range-class guard.
- round 301: §6.2.5.1 `spatial_temporal_weight_code` read +
  Table 7-21 (§7.7.4) resolution wired into
  `macroblock_modes::MacroblockModesTail::parse`. The former
  rejection of `mb_type`s carrying
  `spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag == true` (set by the r294
  scalable B-5/B-6/B-7 tables) is replaced by the actual 2-bit code
  read, gated per §6.2.5.1 on `spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag == 1
  && spatial_temporal_weight_code_table_index != '00'`. New
  `SpatialTemporalWeight` type (re-exported at the crate root) carries
  the resolved `weight_class` (`1`/`2`/`3`), the per-field
  `spatial_temporal_weight(s)` pair (in sixteenths: `0`/`8`/`16`),
  the `is_single` `(a)`-vs-`(a; b)` shape, and the
  `spatial_temporal_integer_weight` flag — all transcribed from the
  Table 7-21 grid. The resolved class now drives the §6.3.17.2
  Field-based motion-vector-count split (Table 6-17) instead of the
  always-`0` context default. `MacroblockModesContext` grows
  `spatial_temporal_weight_code_table_index` (from
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()`, §6.3.14) with a new
  `MacroblockModesContext::scalable` constructor; the existing `new`
  seeds it to `0` so non-scalable callers are byte-identical.
  `MacroblockModesTail` grows `spatial_temporal_weight:
  Option<SpatialTemporalWeight>`. 8 new unit tests (867 lib total):
  the full Table 7-21 grid + out-of-range index, the code-read +
  class-resolution path (classes 1 and 3 driving the 2-vs-1 vector
  split), the `table_index == 00` no-code `00*` row, the flag-clear
  no-read path, truncation, and the scalable-context seeding.
  Empirical note: §6.3.17.1 cites "Table 7-20" for the class
  derivation, but Table 7-20 has no class column; §7.7.4
  authoritatively derives the class from Table 7-21 (used here).
- round 294: Annex B scalable `macroblock_type` tables — B-5
  (I-pictures, spatial scalability), B-6 (P-pictures, spatial
  scalability), B-7 (B-pictures, spatial scalability) and B-8 (I/P/B,
  SNR scalability) — added to the `macroblock_type` module alongside
  the existing non-scalable B-2/B-3/B-4 tables. The `Row` type and
  `MacroblockType` now carry the two extra §6.3.17.1 columns:
  `spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag` (now set per-row, no longer a
  hard `false`) and `spatial_temporal_weight_class`
  (`Option<u8>` — `Some(0)` / `Some(4)` for resolved classes,
  `None` when the flag is set and the class is one of `{1,2,3}` to be
  derived later from `spatial_temporal_weight_code` via Table 7-21).
  New `MacroblockTypeTable` enum + `MacroblockTypeTable::select`
  derive the table family from `scalable_mode` + picture type + the
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()`-present flag per Table 6-10
  (spatial scalability falls back to the non-scalable tables when the
  current picture lacks the spatial-scalable extension; data
  partitioning and temporal scalability always use B-2/B-3/B-4; SNR
  uses B-8). `MacroblockType::parse` keeps the non-scalable default;
  `MacroblockType::parse_with_table` takes an explicit family. The
  longest-first VLC walk now spans 1..=9 bits (B-7's deepest
  codewords). 11 new unit tests (861 lib total): every B-5/B-7 row,
  the B-6 compatible-vs-class-4 split, all three B-8 codewords across
  every picture type, the Table 6-10 selector, prefix-freeness of all
  four new tables, and parse/parse_with_table equivalence.

- round 291: §6.2.3.5 `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()` parser
  (field semantics §6.3.14) in a new
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension` module and §6.2.3.4
  `picture_temporal_scalable_extension()` parser (field semantics
  §6.3.13) in a new `picture_temporal_scalable_extension` module —
  the last two of the four extensions the r279
  `extension_and_user_data(i)` dispatcher surfaced as
  `Error::NotImplemented`, closing that surface entirely.
  `PictureSpatialScalableExtension` carries
  `lower_layer_temporal_reference`, the two 15-bit `simsbf`
  `lower_layer_horizontal_offset` / `lower_layer_vertical_offset`
  (read via `read_i32`, full `[-16384, 16383]` range),
  `spatial_temporal_weight_code_table_index` (§7.7 Table 7-20/7-21),
  `lower_layer_progressive_frame`, and
  `lower_layer_deinterlaced_field_select`; its `validate(chroma_format)`
  helper enforces the §6.3.14 even-offset rules (horizontal even for
  4:2:0/4:2:2, vertical even for 4:2:0) the bare wire parse cannot
  see. `PictureTemporalScalableExtension` carries
  `reference_select_code`, `forward_temporal_reference`, and
  `backward_temporal_reference`; its `validate(picture_coding_type)`
  helper enforces the §7.9 / Table 7-28 / Table 7-29
  `reference_select_code` constraints (I-pictures shall be `'11'`,
  `'11'` forbidden in P-pictures, `'00'` forbidden in B-pictures).
  Both are wired into the r279 dispatcher's `i = 2` allowable set
  (new `ExtensionAndUserData` fields
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension` /
  `picture_temporal_scalable_extension`), so no
  `extension_and_user_data(i)` path returns `Error::NotImplemented`
  any longer. Both `marker_bit` / start-code / identifier rejection
  sites are covered. 29 new bit-exact unit tests.
- round 283: §6.2.2.5 `sequence_scalable_extension()` parser (field
  semantics §6.3.7) in a new `sequence_scalable_extension` module and
  §6.2.3.6 `copyright_extension()` parser (field semantics §6.3.15)
  in a new `copyright_extension` module — the first two of the four
  extensions the r279 `extension_and_user_data(i)` dispatcher
  surfaced as `Error::NotImplemented`. New types:
  `SequenceScalableExtension` (`scalable_mode` + `layer_id`),
  `ScalableMode` (Table 6-10 — all four 2-bit codes are defined, no
  reserved row; each scalability type carries its §6.2.2.5
  mode-conditional parameter block in the variant),
  `SpatialScalabilityParams` (the two 14-bit lower-layer prediction
  sizes + the four 5-bit §7.7.2 subsampling factors, *"the value
  zero is forbidden"* enforced on each), `TemporalScalabilityParams`
  (`picture_mux_enable`, the conditionally-present
  `mux_to_progressive_sequence`, `picture_mux_order`,
  `picture_mux_factor` with the §6.3.7 reserved `'000'` rejected
  when `picture_mux_enable` is set — the only case the field is
  used — and preserved raw otherwise), and `CopyrightExtension`
  (`copyright_flag` / `copyright_identifier` / `original_or_copy` +
  the three number fields and the §6.3.15 64-bit
  `copyright_number()` derivation `(n1 << 44) + (n2 << 22) + n3`).
  Enforced rejection sites beyond the wire shape: the §6.1 / §6.3.7
  `layer_id` pins (data partitioning ⇒ partition 0 or 1; spatial /
  SNR / temporal ⇒ at least 1, because the base layer carries no
  `sequence_scalable_extension()` outside data partitioning), the
  spatial-block marker bit, the §6.3.15 *"shall have the value
  zero"* 7-bit `reserved` field, the three copyright marker bits,
  and the §6.3.15 clear-flag (`copyright_identifier` and
  `copyright_number` shall be 0) and zero-identifier
  (`copyright_number` shall be 0) constraints. Both parsers expose
  the crate-standard `parse` / `parse_with_reader` pair and are
  wired into the r279 dispatcher's `i = 0` / `i = 2` allowable sets
  via two new `ExtensionAndUserData` fields
  (`sequence_scalable_extension`, `copyright_extension`); the
  `Error::NotImplemented` surface shrinks to
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()` (§6.2.3.5) and
  `picture_temporal_scalable_extension()` (§6.2.3.4). The
  `SEQUENCE_SCALABLE_EXTENSION_ID` / `COPYRIGHT_EXTENSION_ID`
  constants moved into the new modules (still re-exported at the
  crate root, along with all new types). Follow-ups: the §6.1.1.6 /
  §6.3.7 cross-sequence occurrence rule (*"a bitstream is either
  scalable or it is not scalable"*; all data elements equal across
  repeat sequence headers) needs a
  `SequenceDisplayOrderDriver`-shaped sequence-layer driver, and the
  two picture scalable extension parsers plus the top-level §6.2.2
  `video_sequence()` walker remain future rounds. 34 new unit tests
  (936 total, was 902): the sequence-scalable wire surface across
  all four modes with per-mode encoded-length accounting and seven
  rejection sites (16), the copyright wire surface with the
  concatenation identity and seven rejection sites (13), and the
  dispatcher integration — positive `i = 0` / `i = 2` parses, a
  both-sequence-extensions window, the two wrong-location
  rejections, and the two remaining `NotImplemented` stubs (5 net).
- round 279: §6.2.2.2 `extension_and_user_data(i)` dispatcher plus
  §6.2.2.2.1 `extension_data(i)` and §6.2.2.2.2 `user_data()` in a new
  `extension_and_user_data` module — the §6.2.2 `video_sequence()`
  element invoked at `i = 0` (after `sequence_extension()`), `i = 1`
  (after `group_of_pictures_header()`), and `i = 2` (after
  `picture_coding_extension()`), tying the r261 / r241 / r244
  `sequence_display_extension()` / `quant_matrix_extension()` /
  `picture_display_extension()` parsers into one §5.2.3 start-code
  loop. New types: `ExtensionLocation` (the `i` argument; the `i = 2`
  arm carries `chroma_format` + `PictureDisplayContext`), `UserData`
  (the §6.3.4.1 byte series, terminated by *"receipt of another start
  code"* with the *"no string of 23 or more consecutive zero bits"*
  emulation guard enforced), and `ExtensionAndUserData` (the parsed
  optionals + `user_data` vec + `discarded_reserved_ids` +
  `byte_position_after`, the offset of the foreign start code that
  ended the loop). Enforced rejection sites: §6.2.2.2.1 NOTE
  (`extension_data()` never follows a `group_of_pictures_header()`),
  §6.3.1 at-most-once per extension type, §6.3.1 allowable-set
  (defined ID at the wrong invocation point), §5.2.3 non-zero
  stuffing bytes between elements and non-zero stuffing bits after an
  unaligned extension, and truncation at every lookahead. The §6.3.1
  reserved-identifier rule (*"discard all subsequent data until the
  next start code"*) is a recorded skip, not an error. The four
  spec-defined extensions without crate parsers yet
  (`sequence_scalable_extension()`, `copyright_extension()`,
  `picture_spatial_scalable_extension()`,
  `picture_temporal_scalable_extension()`) surface
  `Error::NotImplemented` — the variant's first user. New constants
  `USER_DATA_START_CODE`, `COPYRIGHT_EXTENSION_ID`,
  `SEQUENCE_SCALABLE_EXTENSION_ID`,
  `PICTURE_SPATIAL_SCALABLE_EXTENSION_ID`,
  `PICTURE_TEMPORAL_SCALABLE_EXTENSION_ID`; all new types re-exported
  at the crate root. The `i = 0` result's
  `sequence_display_extension` field feeds the r271
  `SequenceDisplayOrderDriver::on_sequence_header_window` directly
  (pinned end-to-end by a test). 31 new unit tests: the `user_data()`
  surface (7), positive dispatch shapes across all three locations
  including zero-stuffing and reserved-discard paths (11), every
  rejection site (12), and the §6.3.5 / §6.3.12 driver hand-off (1).
  Follow-up parsers for the four `NotImplemented` extensions
  (§6.2.2.5 / §6.2.3.6 / §6.2.3.5 / §6.2.3.4) and the top-level
  §6.2.2 `video_sequence()` walker remain future rounds.
- round 271: §6.3.5 / §6.3.12 `SequenceDisplayOrderDriver` sequence-layer
  ordering driver in a new `sequence_display_order` module — the two
  cross-element occurrence constraints r261's
  `sequence_display_extension()` parser deferred to "sequence-layer
  driver work". The driver owns the running
  `sequence_display_extension()` presence/value fact across one MPEG-2
  sequence and exposes the two checks as named methods, mirroring the
  `FrameCentreOffsetDriver` / `QuantMatrixDriver` shape.
  `on_sequence_header_window(Option<SequenceDisplayExtension>)` observes
  each `sequence_header()`-to-`picture_header()` window: the first call
  pins the §6.3.5 requirement (`Requirement::Forbidden` when absent,
  `Requirement::RequiredEqual(first)` when present), and every later
  call is checked against the pin per §6.3.5 *"all subsequent sequence
  headers shall be followed by `sequence_display_extension()` in which
  all data elements are the same as in the first … Conversely if no
  `sequence_display_extension()` occurs … then
  `sequence_display_extension()` shall not occur in the bitstream"* —
  rejecting a present-where-forbidden, absent-where-required, or
  differing-value repeat as `InvalidBitstream`.
  `check_picture_display_extension()` (and the bool accessor
  `picture_display_extension_permitted()`) answer the §6.3.12 gate
  *"a `picture_display_extension()` shall not occur unless a
  `sequence_display_extension()` followed the previous
  `sequence_header()`"* from the running presence fact. New types
  `SequenceDisplayOrderDriver` (`Copy + Default`; `Default` ↔ `new`,
  both at the pre-first-`sequence_header()` baseline) and `Requirement`
  (`Unpinned` / `Forbidden` / `RequiredEqual`) are re-exported at the
  crate root. The r261 doc-comment notes in `sequence_display_extension`
  and the `picture_display_extension` "Order constraint" note now point
  at the driver instead of flagging the rules as pending. 14 new unit
  tests cover the pre-window baseline, the two first-window pins, the
  Forbidden absent-ok / present-rejected pair, the RequiredEqual
  equal-ok / absent-rejected / differing-size-rejected /
  differing-colour-rejected quartet, the §6.3.12 gate before and after
  a present/absent window, and the two multi-window idempotency chains.
- round 261: §6.2.2.4 `sequence_display_extension()` parser plus the
  §6.3.6 field semantics in a new `sequence_display_extension` module
  — the first of the two sequence-layer elements the §6.3.12 ordering
  constraint (*"a `picture_display_extension()` shall not occur unless
  a `sequence_display_extension()` followed the previous
  `sequence_header()`"*) binds, flagged as unhandled by the r244
  order-constraint note the r260 `FrameCentreOffsetDriver` inherited.
  New types: `SequenceDisplayExtension` (the parsed element),
  `VideoFormat` (Table 6-6 — component / PAL / NTSC / SECAM / MAC /
  unspecified, with the reserved `110` / `111` codes preserved raw per
  the `AspectRatio::Reserved` policy since §6.3.6 says the field does
  not affect the decoding process; `Default` is pinned to
  `Unspecified` per the §6.3.6 absence rule), `ColourDescription`
  (the optional `colour_primaries` / `transfer_characteristics` /
  `matrix_coefficients` triple gated on the wire's
  `colour_description` flag, raw 8-bit components with the
  *"(forbidden)"* value `0` of each defining Table 6-7 / 6-8 / 6-9
  rejected at parse time and the reserved upper codes preserved), and
  the constant `SEQUENCE_DISPLAY_EXTENSION_ID = 0b0010` naming the
  Table 6-2 identifier. `ColourDescription::ASSUMED` exposes the
  §6.3.6 absence/flag-clear default (every component = the value-1
  row, Rec. ITU-R BT.709);
  `SequenceDisplayExtension::effective_colour_description()` applies
  that rule for parsed-but-flag-clear extensions. Parser enforces
  every §6.2.2.4 rejection site: 32-bit `extension_start_code`
  (`0x000001B5`), 4-bit `extension_start_code_identifier` (`0010`),
  the three forbidden-zero colour bytes, and the `marker_bit` between
  the two 14-bit `display_horizontal_size` / `display_vertical_size`
  fields (§6.3.6 units: samples / lines of the encoded frames). The
  §6.3.5 repeat-sequence-header occurrence constraint and the §6.3.12
  ordering gate remain sequence-layer driver work — the module
  doc-comment quotes both so the follow-up driver round can wire the
  presence fact into `FrameCentreOffsetDriver` without re-reading the
  spec. 18 new bit-exact unit tests cover the no-colour and
  full-colour positive parses, all six described Table 6-6 codes plus
  the two reserved codes, the 14-bit `0x3FFF` display-size
  round-trip, reserved colour codes above the described rows, the
  encoded bit-length accounting for both shapes (69 / 93 bits → 9 /
  12 padded bytes), the six rejection paths (wrong start code, wrong
  id, three forbidden-zero colour bytes, zero marker bit), two
  truncation points, and the three §6.3.6 absence-default rules.
- round 260: §6.3.12 `FrameCentreOffsetDriver` picture-level state
  machine that owns the running `FrameCentreOffsetState` across one
  MPEG-2 sequence and exposes the two §6.3.12 carry-over events as
  named methods, mirroring the round-254 `QuantMatrixDriver` shape so
  picture-driver authors stop spelling the
  `state.reset_to_zero()` / `state.apply(&ext)` dance themselves.
  `FrameCentreOffsetDriver::on_sequence_header()` invokes
  `FrameCentreOffsetState::reset_to_zero` per *"Following a
  `sequence_header()` the value zero shall be used for all frame
  centre offsets until a `picture_display_extension()` defines
  non-zero values"* (§6.3.12 rule 1).
  `FrameCentreOffsetDriver::on_picture_display_extension(ext)`
  composes a parsed `PictureDisplayExtension` onto the running state
  through the already-landed `FrameCentreOffsetState::apply`,
  adopting the first (transmission-order) `(horizontal, vertical)`
  pair as the new "most recently decoded frame centre offset" the
  §6.3.12 NOTE clarifies is sufficient even when two or three pairs
  are carried. `FrameCentreOffsetDriver::state()` returns a `Copy`
  snapshot a display-side caller can plumb downstream without
  borrowing the driver — pictures that omit the extension simply
  skip the second call and the carried snapshot threads forward per
  §6.3.12 rule 2 *"In the case that a given picture does not have a
  `picture_display_extension()` then the most recently decoded
  frame centre offset shall be used"*. Seven new unit tests cover
  the driver surface (`new` ↔ §6.3.12 zero baseline,
  `Default` ↔ `new`, sequence-header reset after an extension
  mutation, first-pair adoption matches the field-level
  `FrameCentreOffsetState::apply` byte-for-byte on a 3-pair payload,
  no-event picture carries the previous offset unchanged, two-cycle
  reset → apply → reset → apply idempotency, snapshot returned by
  value so local mutations leave the running state intact).
- round 254: §6.3.11 `QuantMatrixDriver` picture-level state machine
  that owns the running `QuantiserMatrixState` across one MPEG-2
  sequence and exposes the two §6.3.11 lifecycle events as named
  methods so picture-driver callers stop spelling the state-mutation
  dance themselves. `QuantMatrixDriver::on_sequence_header()` invokes
  `QuantiserMatrixState::reset_to_defaults` per *"When a
  `sequence_header_code` is decoded all matrices shall be reset to
  their default values"* (§6.3.11). `QuantMatrixDriver::on_quant_matrix_extension(
  ext, chroma_format)` composes a parsed `QuantMatrixExtension` onto
  the running state through the already-landed `QuantMatrixExtension::apply`,
  honouring the four-flag sequencing and 4:2:2 / 4:4:4
  chroma-follows-luma rule. `QuantMatrixDriver::state()` returns a
  `Copy` snapshot the slice-walker builder
  `SliceWalkContext::with_quantiser_matrices` consumes verbatim. Six
  new unit tests cover the driver surface (`new` ↔ §6.3.7 defaults,
  `Default` ↔ `new`, sequence-header reset after an extension
  mutation, extension shim matches the field-level API on a 4:4:4
  luma + chroma payload, two-cycle reset → apply → reset → apply
  idempotency, snapshot return-by-value). Two new integration tests
  prove the end-to-end driver → slice-walker arithmetic on the r251
  single-AC fixture: feeding a hand-built `quant_matrix_extension()`
  (intra-luma cells = 80) through the driver and dispatching the
  slice via `ctx.with_quantiser_matrices(driver.state())` yields
  `f_quant[0][1] == 140`, and a follow-up `driver.on_sequence_header()`
  brings the next slice's `f_quant[0][1]` back to the r251 baseline
  `28`.
- round 251: §6.3.11 `QuantiserMatrixState` wired through the §6.2.4
  slice walker into the §6.2.6 `block(i)` driver. New field
  `SliceWalkContext::quantiser_matrices: QuantiserMatrixState` carries
  the four §7.4.2.1 Table 7-5 `w`-indexed weighting matrices
  (`intra_luma`, `non_intra_luma`, `intra_chroma`, `non_intra_chroma`)
  per-slice; each existing constructor seeds the field to the §6.3.7
  defaults so prior callers see no behavioural change. New builder
  method `SliceWalkContext::with_quantiser_matrices` chains a parsed
  state onto any constructor so the picture-level driver pattern
  `state.reset_to_defaults(); ext.apply(&mut state, chroma);
  ctx.with_quantiser_matrices(state)` matches the §6.3.11 lifecycle
  spelling 1-to-1. Inside `walk_slice` the four matrices are unpacked
  into the `[[[u8; 8]; 8]; 4]` slot
  `MacroblockBlockContext::weight_matrices` expects, so the §7.4.2.3
  reconstruction step `F''[v][u] = (2*QF + k) * W * quantiser_scale /
  32` picks up the user-downloaded matrices verbatim rather than
  always reading the §6.3.7 defaults. The pre-r251 walker comment
  flagging this surfacing as a follow-up is resolved. Three new
  integration tests pin the wiring: a default-matrix baseline asserts
  `f_quant[0][1] == 28` against a single AC coefficient at zig-zag
  index 1 (`(run=0, level=+1)` Table B-14 NEXT-form), the same
  fixture with `intra_luma[0][1]` overridden to `80` asserts
  `f_quant[0][1] == 140` (a 5× change driven solely by the matrix
  override, confirming the new field reaches the §7.4.2.3 arithmetic),
  and a constructor sweep across `first_slice` / `first_slice_mpeg1`
  / `first_slice_with_block_decoding` confirms every entry-point
  defaults to the §6.3.7 matrices.
- round 244: §6.2.3.3 `picture_display_extension()` parser plus the
  §6.3.12 frame-centre offset state machine. New module
  `picture_display_extension` with `PictureDisplayExtension` (the
  fixed-capacity 1..=3 array of `(horizontal, vertical)` offset pairs),
  `FrameCentreOffset` (one signed-16 component pair),
  `PictureDisplayContext` (the four picture-layer flags §6.3.12 needs:
  `progressive_sequence`, `picture_structure`, `repeat_first_field`,
  `top_field_first`), the standalone
  `number_of_frame_centre_offsets(ctx)` helper transcribing the §6.3.12
  pseudocode 1-to-1, `FrameCentreOffsetState` carrying the §6.3.12
  "most recently decoded" pair with `reset_to_zero` (the
  post-`sequence_header()` reset) and `apply` (extension absorption,
  taking the first offset per the §6.3.12 NOTE), `FieldUsage` capturing
  the between-pictures vs. per-picture application context, and
  `PICTURE_DISPLAY_EXTENSION_ID = 0b0111` naming the Table 6-2
  identifier. Parser enforces every §6.2.3.3 rejection site: 32-bit
  `extension_start_code` (`0x000001B5`), 4-bit
  `extension_start_code_identifier` (`0111`), and the two `marker_bit`
  slots inside every loop iteration. The 16-bit signed (`simsbf`)
  offsets round-trip the full `[-32768, 32767]` range via
  `BitReader::read_i32(16)`. 22 new bit-exact unit tests cover the six
  §6.3.12 derivation arms, the 1 / 2 / 3 positive wire parses, the
  `i16::MIN` / `i16::MAX` boundary, the five rejection paths
  (wrong-start-code, wrong-id, horizontal-marker-zero,
  vertical-marker-zero, short-buffer), the encoded byte-length count
  for each loop arity (9 / 13 / 18 bytes — the count-1 / count-3 sizes
  are post-pad), and the three state-machine cases (zero baseline,
  extension absorption, reset).
- round 241: §6.2.3.2 `quant_matrix_extension()` parser plus the
  §6.3.11 per-sequence weighting-matrix state machine. New module
  `quant_matrix_extension` with `QuantMatrixExtension` (the four
  optional `intra` / `non_intra` / `chroma_intra` /
  `chroma_non_intra` payloads, each a `QuantiserMatrixPayload`),
  `QuantiserMatrixState` (the four §7.4.2.1 / Table 7-5
  `w`-indexed `[[u8; 8]; 8]` slots, initialised to the §6.3.7
  defaults — intra is the published Wf matrix shared with the
  MPEG-1 default, non-intra is the all-16 matrix), and
  `QUANT_MATRIX_EXTENSION_ID = 0b0011` (Table 6-2). Parser
  enforces every §6.3.11 rejection site: 32-bit
  `extension_start_code` (`0x000001B5`), 4-bit
  `extension_start_code_identifier` (`0011`),
  `chroma_format == 4:2:0 ⇒ load_chroma_*_quantiser_matrix ==
  '0'` (both flags), `intra_quantiser_matrix[0] == 8` (luma and
  chroma), and `value zero is forbidden` for every byte of every
  loaded payload. `QuantiserMatrixPayload::to_matrix` lifts the
  on-wire §7.3.1 default-zigzag-order bytes through
  `mpeg2_inverse_scan::inverse_scan_table(false)` into the
  row-major `W[v][u]` layout. `QuantMatrixExtension::apply`
  composes the four optionals against a
  `QuantiserMatrixState` per the §6.3.11 sequencing
  (luma-load first, optional chroma-load override second; the
  4:2:2 / 4:4:4 luma load copies into the chroma slot, while the
  4:2:0 luma load leaves chroma untouched).
  `QuantiserMatrixState::reset_to_defaults` performs the
  §6.3.11 `sequence_header_code` reset. 24 new bit-exact unit
  tests cover the positive parses (no-load / intra-only /
  non-intra-only / all-four), the 4:2:0 chroma-flag rejection
  pair, the byte-zero rejection pair, the intra first-byte-8
  rejection pair, the wrong-start-code / wrong-id / short-buffer
  rejection trio, the byte-alignment count for both empty and
  fully-loaded extensions, the §7.3.1 `to_matrix` round-trip, and
  the four `apply` sequencing cases (luma→chroma copy at 4:2:2 /
  4:4:4 vs. no copy at 4:2:0, chroma-load override on top of a
  same-extension luma-load, default reset). The walker's existing
  §6.3.7-default fallback in
  [`slice_macroblock_walk::walk_slice`] is now flagged with a
  forward pointer at the comment site so the next round can wire
  the state through `SliceWalkContext` without re-reading the
  spec.
- round 238: §7.6.3.1 PMV reconstruction wired into the §6.2.5
  `motion_vectors()` parser path. New
  `pmv::decode_motion_vector(pmv, r, s, t, motion_code,
  motion_residual, f_code)` — the brief-signature per-component
  entry point that wraps the round-12 `reconstruct_component`
  for the dominant non-vertical-half-pred case, threading the
  resulting `vector'[r][s][t]` back into `pmv[r][s][t]`. New
  `slice_macroblock_walk::reconstruct_record_motion_vectors(record,
  pmv, ctx)` — the wire-to-recon helper that reads a
  `MacroblockRecord`'s parsed `motion_vectors_forward` /
  `motion_vectors_backward`, runs `reconstruct_motion_vector`
  per `(r, s)` slot, and returns `ReconstructedMotionVectors`
  carrying per-`(r, s)` `ReconstructedVector` pairs (horizontal
  + vertical post-wrap `vector'[r][s][:]`). Honours the
  §6.3.17.1 / Table 6-19 absent-modes-tail default through the
  existing `effective_motion_type` derivation. Eleven new
  bit-exact tests cover the worked-example surface
  (zero-code, f_code-2 / f_code-3 residual paths with sign
  flip, wrap-around in both directions, residual presence
  gating, slot isolation) and the two-MB PMV accumulation
  across the slice walker.
- round 34: MPEG-2 §6.2.6 `block(i)` driver wired into the
  slice walker as an opt-in path. `slice_macroblock_walk::walk_slice`
  now calls [`crate::mpeg2_decode_macroblock_blocks`] for every
  coded block per the parsed `pattern_code[i]` whenever the new
  `SliceWalkContext::block_decoding_enabled` flag is `true`,
  chaining §7.2.1 DC prelude (intra blocks only), §7.2.2 residual
  VLC walker (B-14 / B-15 with §7.2.2.2 FIRST/NEXT alternation),
  §7.3 inverse scan, §7.4 inverse quantisation (Table 7-5
  weighting-matrix selection driven by `(BlockCoding, Component,
  ChromaFormat)`), and §A 8×8 IDCT into a single
  "bitstream → `f[y][x]`" pass per coded block. Maintains the
  §7.2.1 per-component DC predictor `dc_dct_pred[cc]` across
  macroblocks for the duration of the slice (allocated at slice
  start with the Table 7-2 reset value for the active
  `intra_dc_precision`; reset on every non-intra MB by the
  inner driver). `SliceWalkContext` grows five new fields —
  `intra_vlc_format` / `alternate_scan` / `intra_dc_precision`
  (with the Table 6-13 `0..=3` range enforced before the loop
  ever runs) / `q_scale_type` (driving the §7.4.2.2 Table 7-6
  `quantiser_scale_value` resolution from the carried-forward
  `quantiser_scale_code`) and `block_decoding_enabled`. All four
  existing constructors (`first_slice`,
  `first_slice_with_picture_extension`,
  `first_slice_with_picture_body`, `first_slice_mpeg1`) default
  the new fields to "block decoding off" (`false` /
  `intra_dc_precision = 0`) so the round-30..33 contract holds
  bit-identically — the walker stops at the
  `coded_block_pattern()` snapshot and emits no §6.2.6 reads. A
  new `first_slice_with_block_decoding` constructor surfaces the
  full §6.3.5 / §6.3.11 picture-extension state plus the four
  §6.2.6 fields and turns the gate on. `MacroblockRecord` gains
  `decoded_blocks: Option<Vec<DecodedBlock>>` — `None` in the
  wire-only path (round-30..33 contract), `Some(empty)` for a
  decoded MB with zero coded blocks (e.g. P-picture "MC, not
  coded"), or `Some([…])` with one entry per coded block
  (each carrying the full `QFS[]` / `QF[v][u]` / `F[v][u]` /
  `f[y][x]` reconstruction plus the post-EOB bit cursor). The
  §6.3.7 default weighting matrices are used —
  `quant_matrix_extension()` downloadable-matrix support is a
  separate follow-up clause. The §6.1.1.8 block ordering per
  chroma_format (4:2:0 = 6 blocks, 4:2:2 = 8, 4:4:4 = 12) is
  threaded straight through from
  `mpeg2_macroblock_blocks::block_count` /
  `mpeg2_macroblock_blocks::block_component`. The walker's
  `body_bit_position` snapshot keeps the round-30..33 meaning
  (cursor after `macroblock_modes()` + `quantiser_scale_code`,
  before any wire-body field) so external resume-from-cursor
  drivers stay unbroken; the new per-block `end_of_block_bit_position`
  exposed by [`crate::Mpeg2DecodedBlock::end_of_block_bit_position`]
  gives the post-§6.2.6 cursor on each emitted block. 7 new lib
  unit tests plus 3 new integration tests in
  `tests/slice_macroblock_walk_synthetic.rs` pin the wire-only
  vs block-decoding split, the 4:2:0 DC-only intra MB walk (6
  blocks, predictor reset to 128 with `intra_dc_precision == 0`),
  per-slice DC predictor advance across two intra MBs, the
  `intra_dc_precision == 4` pre-flight rejection, the
  linear-vs-non-linear `q_scale_type` lookup, and the
  `pattern_code` all-`false` empty-decoded-blocks path. The
  `DecodedBlock` types under `mpeg2_block_decoder` and
  `mpeg2_macroblock_blocks` now derive `PartialEq` / `Eq` so the
  enclosing `MacroblockRecord::decoded_blocks` keeps the
  walker's record-level `PartialEq` / `Eq` derive intact.
- round 33: MPEG-2 §6.2.5 macroblock body wire-parse wired into the
  slice walker. `slice_macroblock_walk::walk_slice` now follows
  `macroblock_modes()` + `quantiser_scale_code` with the four
  spec-deterministic body fields: `motion_vectors(0)` (gated on
  `macroblock_motion_forward == 1` OR `macroblock_intra &&
  concealment_motion_vectors == 1` per §6.2.5 / §6.3.11),
  `motion_vectors(1)` (`macroblock_motion_backward == 1`),
  `marker_bit` (the §6.3.17 concealment-MV `'1'` bit on intra
  macroblocks with `concealment_motion_vectors == 1` — a `'0'`
  here is rejected as `InvalidBitstream`), and
  `coded_block_pattern()` (`macroblock_pattern == 1`, with the
  §6.3.17.4 `pattern_code[12]` derivation pre-computed for the
  caller). Each is **wire-syntax only**: the §7.6.3.1 reconstruction
  of `vector'[r][s][t]` against the PMV state (and the §7.6.3.3 PMV
  update / §7.6.3.4 reset) stay deferred to the picture-level
  driver one layer up. `SliceWalkContext` grows six new fields —
  `f_code_fwd_horiz` / `f_code_fwd_vert` / `f_code_bwd_horiz` /
  `f_code_bwd_vert` (the four §6.3.11 `f_code[s][t]` widths driving
  `motion_residual`), `concealment_motion_vectors` (the §6.3.11
  intra-MB motion-vector / marker-bit gate), and `chroma_format`
  (the §6.3.5 `Yuv420` / `Yuv422` / `Yuv444` setting driving the
  §6.2.5.3 `coded_block_pattern_1` / `coded_block_pattern_2`
  extensions and the §6.3.17.4 `pattern_code` indexing). All three
  existing constructors keep their original signatures: `first_slice`,
  `first_slice_with_picture_extension`, and `first_slice_mpeg1`
  default the new fields to spec-legal "no body fields fire"
  placeholders (`f_code = 1`, `concealment_motion_vectors = false`,
  `chroma_format = Yuv420`) so the round-30..32 tests stay
  bit-identical. A new `first_slice_with_picture_body` surfaces the
  full pair so callers walking P/B slices, intra-concealment-MV
  slices, or 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 pictures can thread the real picture +
  sequence extension values through. `MacroblockRecord` gains five
  new fields — `motion_vectors_forward: Option<MotionVectors>`,
  `motion_vectors_backward: Option<MotionVectors>`,
  `concealment_marker_bit: Option<bool>`, `coded_block_pattern:
  Option<CodedBlockPattern>`, and `pattern_code: [bool; 12]` — and
  drops `Copy` (now `Clone` only) since two of those carry
  `Vec`-backed motion-vector entry lists. The `body_bit_position`
  cursor keeps its round-30..32 meaning: the offset right after
  `macroblock_modes()` + the §6.2.5 `quantiser_scale_code`, *before*
  any of the new wire-body fields, so any external driver that
  resumes parsing from `body_bit_position` is unaffected by this
  round's additions. The walker also synthesises a defaulted
  `MotionType` (Frame-based for frame pictures, Field-based for
  field pictures, `mv_count = 1`, `dmv = 0`) per §6.3.17.1 / Table
  6-19 in the absent-modes-tail case (frame picture with
  `frame_pred_frame_dct == 1` motion MB, or intra MB with
  concealment vectors) so `motion_vectors()` can still parse.
  10 new lib unit tests plus 4 new integration tests in
  `tests/slice_macroblock_walk_synthetic.rs` pin the new gates:
  the bare-intra full-`pattern_code` derivation, the
  concealment-MV `motion_vectors(0) + marker_bit` pair (including
  the `'0'`-marker rejection), the §6.3.17.4 CBP-driven 4:2:0 /
  4:2:2 / 4:4:4 `pattern_code` derivations, the B-picture
  `motion_vectors(0) + motion_vectors(1)` pair, the
  no-motion-no-pattern empty-pattern_code path, and the
  `body_bit_position` snapshot-before-body-fields contract. The
  integration tests also update the prior round-30 fixtures to
  carry valid `motion_vectors(0)` + CBP wire bits so the
  end-to-end `SliceHeader::parse → walk_slice` chain keeps green.
- round 32: MPEG-2 §6.2.5.1 `macroblock_modes()` tail wired into
  the slice walker. `slice_macroblock_walk::walk_slice` now reads
  `frame_motion_type` (Table 6-17, frame pictures with
  `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0` whose MB sets a motion flag),
  `field_motion_type` (Table 6-18, every motion-bearing MB in a
  field picture), and `dct_type` (frame pictures with
  `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0` whose MB is intra or has a coded
  pattern) between the existing `macroblock_type` parse and the
  §6.2.5 `if (macroblock_quant) quantiser_scale_code` read,
  matching the §6.2.5 syntax tree order. Two new
  `SliceWalkContext` fields `picture_structure` and
  `frame_pred_frame_dct` surface the §6.3.11 picture-extension
  state the tail is gated on; `SliceWalkContext::first_slice`
  keeps its existing 4-arg shorthand by defaulting to
  `picture_structure = Frame` / `frame_pred_frame_dct = true` (no
  tail reads — safe for I-pictures and the `frame_pred_frame_dct
  == 1` P/B case), while
  `first_slice_with_picture_extension` takes the full pair, and
  the new `first_slice_mpeg1` shorthand pins both fields so the
  §6.2.5.1 tail stays gated off on MPEG-1 streams (whose macroblock
  layer has its own §2.4.2.7 motion-vector parser). `MacroblockRecord`
  gains `motion_type: Option<MotionType>` and `dct_type: Option<bool>`
  alongside the existing `macroblock_type` / `quantiser_scale_code`
  fields. **Fixes a latent ordering bug** where the previous
  walker read the §6.2.5 `quantiser_scale_code` immediately after
  `macroblock_type`, misaligning the cursor on any MB whose
  `macroblock_modes()` tail consumed bits (e.g. P-picture
  `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0` motion MBs). 7 new lib tests plus 3
  new integration tests in `tests/slice_macroblock_walk_synthetic.rs`
  pin the four gate cases — frame_motion_type / field_motion_type /
  motion-omitted-by-frame_pred_frame_dct / dct_type emitted-with-intra
  — and a full P-picture MB chain that mixes type-tail-quant in one
  bit-exact 14-bit fixture.
- round 31: MPEG-2 §7.6.6 skipped-macroblock specification
  (`skipped_macroblock::describe_skipped_macroblock` +
  `skipped_macroblock_apply_to_pmv`) — the description module the
  round-30 slice walker flagged as a follow-up.
  `describe_skipped_macroblock` consumes a
  `SkippedMacroblockContext` (picture coding type / picture
  structure / previous-MB direction / PMV state /
  scalable_i_picture gate) and returns a `SkippedMacroblock` that
  pins the per-§7.6.6.1..4 deterministic prediction shape: the
  prediction type (Frame-based for §7.6.6.2 / §7.6.6.4,
  Field-based for §7.6.6.1 / §7.6.6.3), the derived `mv_format`,
  the same-parity field reference (§7.6.6.1 / §7.6.6.3), the
  direction (always `Forward` in P-pictures per §7.6.6.1 /
  §7.6.6.2; inherited from the previous MB in B-pictures per
  §7.6.6.3 / §7.6.6.4 "same as the previous macroblock"), the
  motion-vector source (`SkippedMotionVector::Zero` in
  P-pictures, `SkippedMotionVector::FromPmv { forward,
  backward }` in B-pictures with each slot present iff the
  inherited direction includes it), and the `reset_pmv` flag
  (true in P-pictures per §7.6.3.4 "In a P-picture when a
  macroblock is skipped" + §7.6.6.1 / §7.6.6.2 "Motion vector
  predictors shall be reset to zero"; false in B-pictures per
  §7.6.6.3 / §7.6.6.4 "Motion vector predictors are
  unaffected"). The §7.6.6 preamble I-picture rule rejects
  skipped MBs on non-scalable I-pictures; the
  `scalable_i_picture` gate exposes the spec exemption but
  surfaces "not yet supported" until the scalability extensions
  land. B-pictures with `previous_direction =
  PredictionDirection::Skipped` are also rejected per the
  "same as the previous macroblock" rule. The companion
  `skipped_macroblock_apply_to_pmv` hook fires the §7.6.3.4
  PMV reset (idempotent; no-op when `reset_pmv == false`). The
  module re-uses existing crate types (`Pmv` / `VectorIndex` /
  `Direction` / `Component` from `pmv`, `PictureCodingType` /
  `PictureStructure` from `picture_header`, `PredictionType` /
  `MvFormat` from `macroblock_modes`, `PredictionDirection`
  from `combine_predictions`, `FieldParity` from `dual_prime`)
  so the description plugs straight into the existing §7.6.4
  `predict_block` → §7.6.7 `combine_directional_predictions`
  prediction pipeline (sample-plane formation stays out of
  scope, since per-block residuals are conceptually zero for
  skipped MBs). New types
  `SkippedMacroblockContext` / `SkippedMacroblock` /
  `SkippedMotionVector` and entry points
  `describe_skipped_macroblock` /
  `skipped_macroblock_apply_to_pmv` are re-exported at the
  crate root. 15 new lib unit tests + 5 new integration tests
  under `tests/skipped_macroblock_synthetic.rs` pin the four
  §7.6.6 sub-clause derivations, the §7.6.6 preamble I-picture
  rejection (both non-scalable and scalable-but-unsupported),
  the B-picture previous-direction-Skipped rejection, the
  P-picture PMV reset (idempotent over a 10-MB run), and the
  B-picture PMV invariance over a 5-MB run.
- round 30: MPEG-2 §6.2.4 slice-level macroblock-header walker
  (`slice_macroblock_walk::walk_slice`) — the first §6.2.4 driver
  that picks up at the post-`slice_header()` cursor and walks the
  `do { macroblock() } while ( nextbits() != '0000 0000 0000 0000
  0000 0000' )` loop, parsing each macroblock's spec-deterministic
  header chain: §6.2.5 `macroblock_address_increment` (Table B-1
  with the `macroblock_escape` / MPEG-1 `macroblock_stuffing`
  chains), §6.2.5.1 `macroblock_modes()` opener (`macroblock_type`
  VLC against Tables B-2 / B-3 / B-4 keyed on
  `picture_coding_type`), and the conditional 5-bit
  macroblock-level `quantiser_scale_code` when `macroblock_quant
  == 1`. The driver tracks the §6.3.17.1 per-slice state across
  iterations — `previous_macroblock_address` seeded from
  `mb_row * mb_width - 1`, `macroblock_address` advancing through
  the increment chain, `past_intra_address` advancing to
  `macroblock_address` on every intra macroblock,
  `quantiser_scale_code` carried forward across macroblocks with
  intra-quant overrides applying to *this* MB and every
  subsequent MB in the slice — and rejects the first-MB
  increment-must-be-1 violation. Skipped-macroblock ranges
  (§6.3.17.4 / §7.6.6) are surfaced per record as
  `skipped_macroblock_count = increment - 1` so a future §7.6.6
  round can reconstruct them, without running the §7.6.6
  prediction itself here. The stop-condition peek is
  alignment-agnostic per §5.2.3 — the loop exits as soon as
  `nextbits()` shows 23 zero bits or the buffer runs out (the
  caller bounds the slice sub-buffer). New `SliceWalkContext` /
  `MacroblockRecord` / `SliceWalk` types are re-exported at the
  crate root alongside `walk_slice` and the
  `PAST_INTRA_ADDRESS_RESET = -2` sentinel from §6.3.17.1. 10 new
  lib unit tests + 5 new integration tests under
  `tests/slice_macroblock_walk_synthetic.rs` pin the empty-slice
  stop-pattern early-exit, the single-intra-MB I-picture walk,
  the §6.3.17.1 `macroblock_quant` override + carry-forward
  across subsequent MBs, the explicit override-then-reset
  three-MB walk, the first-MB-increment-rejection, the P-picture
  skipped-MB recording across a `mb_row=1` slice (starting at
  addr 22 with an increment-3 producing 2 skipped MBs), the
  intra `past_intra_address` advance across consecutive intra
  MBs, the rejection of zero `initial_quantiser_scale_code` /
  zero `mb_width`, the post-header `body_bit_position` accounting
  (entry point for the deferred `motion_vectors()` /
  `coded_block_pattern()` / `block(i)` driver rounds), and the
  end-to-end `SliceHeader::parse` + `walk_slice` chain on a
  hand-built slice-start-code-prefixed buffer. The
  `macroblock_modes()` tail (motion-type / dct_type),
  `motion_vectors(s)`, `coded_block_pattern()`, and the per-block
  walker stay out of scope this round — their PMV reset / f_code
  / per-block-context wiring intersects with cross-MB state that
  the picture-level driver above this slice walker needs to own;
  this driver exposes per-MB `body_bit_position` so each
  follow-on round can resume parsing at the post-header cursor.

- round 29: MPEG-2 §6.2.5 / §6.2.6 macroblock-block driver
  (`mpeg2_macroblock_blocks::decode_macroblock_blocks`) — the
  wrapper that walks a macroblock's `pattern_code[12]` array and
  dispatches the round-28 §6.2.6 `block(i)` driver
  (`mpeg2_block_decoder::decode_block`) once per coded slot,
  returning a `Vec<DecodedBlock>` paired with the §6.1.1.8
  block-index position. New `block_count(chroma_format)` (6 / 8 /
  12) and `block_component(i, chroma_format)` helpers encode the
  Figure 6-10 / 6-11 / 6-12 layout (4:2:0 = Y0..Y3 / Cb / Cr;
  4:2:2 = Y0..Y3 / Cb0..Cb1 / Cr0..Cr1; 4:4:4 = Y0..Y3 / Cb0..Cb3
  / Cr0..Cr3). The driver auto-derives the §7.4.2.1 Table 7-5
  weighting-matrix index `w` per coded block from `(coding,
  component, chroma_format)`, honours the §7.2.1 non-intra
  macroblock DC-predictor reset, validates the macroblock-level
  constants up-front (`intra_dc_precision ≤ 3`,
  `quantiser_scale_value ≠ 0`, predictor precision matches
  context precision), and propagates the first failing block's
  error without walking the rest. New `MacroblockBlockContext`
  groups the per-macroblock constants (`intra_vlc_format`,
  `alternate_scan`, `intra_dc_precision`, `quantiser_scale_value`,
  `chroma_format`, four weighting matrices); the per-block
  triplet (`component`, `macroblock_intra`, `weight`) is derived
  inside the driver from the parsed `MacroblockType` and the
  block index. `DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MATRICES` exposes the §6.3.7
  defaults indexed by Table 7-5 (intra luma, non-intra luma,
  intra chroma, non-intra chroma). Re-exported at the crate root
  as `mpeg2_decode_macroblock_blocks`,
  `Mpeg2MacroblockBlockContext`, `Mpeg2MacroblockDecodedBlock`,
  `mpeg2_block_component`, `mpeg2_block_count`,
  `MPEG2_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MATRICES`. 15 new lib unit tests +
  6 new integration tests under
  `tests/mpeg2_macroblock_blocks_synthetic.rs` pin the §6.1.1.8
  block-index → component mapping across all three chroma
  formats, the six-block intra walk for 4:2:0, the eight-block
  4:2:2 walk (Cb-then-Cr ordering), the twelve-block 4:4:4 walk,
  the `pattern_code[]` gating (uncoded slots not consumed),
  Table 7-5 weighting-matrix dispatch for a 4:4:4 non-intra
  chroma block, the §7.2.1 non-intra-macroblock predictor reset,
  the intra-macroblock predictor-carry-over (no reset at MB
  entry), the cross-block DC predictor chain (128 → 129 → 130 →
  131 → 132 across four luma blocks with `dct_diff = +1` each),
  the bit-cursor accounting (28 bits for six size-0 intra blocks
  in 4:2:0), and the three argument-validation paths plus the
  first-failing-block propagation. This closes the round-28
  next-step candidate; the remaining MPEG-2 decode gap is the
  slice-layer driver that loops over macroblocks (parsing
  `macroblock_address_increment` / `macroblock_type` /
  `coded_block_pattern` / motion vectors per MB and dispatching
  to this macroblock-block driver per coded macroblock).

- round 28: MPEG-2 §6.2.6 `block(i)` driver
  (`mpeg2_block_decoder::decode_block`) — chains the §7.2.1 DC
  prelude (intra blocks only) → §7.2.2 residual VLC walker (with
  the §7.2.2.2 NOTE 2 / NOTE 3 FIRST / NEXT alternation honoured)
  → §7.3 inverse scan (Figure 7-2 / Figure 7-3 keyed off
  `alternate_scan`) → §7.4 inverse-quantisation pipeline
  (saturation + §7.4.4 mismatch control included) → §A 8×8 IDCT
  into a single "bitstream → `f[y][x]` plane" entry point. New
  `Mpeg2BlockContext` groups the per-macroblock constants
  (`intra_vlc_format`, `alternate_scan`, `intra_dc_precision`,
  `quantiser_scale_value`); per-block parameters
  (`component`, `macroblock_intra`, `weight`) move with each
  call. `Mpeg2DecodedBlock` carries the four intermediate planes
  (`QFS[]`, `QF[v][u]`, `F[v][u]`, `f[y][x]`) plus the post-EOB
  bit cursor. §7.2.2 wire-position constraint
  (`walker_index + run ≤ 63`) enforced as an `InvalidBitstream`
  rejection. Re-exported at the crate root as
  `mpeg2_decode_block`, `Mpeg2BlockContext`, and
  `Mpeg2DecodedBlock`. 16 new lib unit tests +
  7 new integration tests under
  `tests/mpeg2_block_decoder_synthetic.rs`.
- round 27: MPEG-2 §7.2.1 intra-block DC prelude — Annex B
  Tables B-12 (`dct_dc_size_luminance`) and B-13
  (`dct_dc_size_chrominance`) extended to `0..=11` with the
  long-prefix entries for `intra_dc_precision != 0`; §7.2.1
  `dc_dct_differential` → `dct_diff` `half_range`-threshold
  reconstruction (cross-checked against the §2.4.3.7 MPEG-1
  MSB-test form for every size 1..=8 input); per-component
  `dc_dct_pred[Y / Cb / Cr]` predictor state with Table 7-2 reset
  values `{128, 256, 512, 1024}` for `intra_dc_precision ∈
  {0, 1, 2, 3}`; the three-trigger reset contract (start of
  slice / non-intra macroblock / skipped macroblock); and the
  §7.2.1 `QFS[0] ∈ [0, 2^(8 + intra_dc_precision) - 1]`
  bitstream-constraint enforcement on the final predicted DC.
  Public driver `mpeg2_decode_dc_block(br, predictors, colour)`
  returns a typed `Mpeg2DcCoefficient` with the raw bits, signed
  `dct_diff`, final `QFS[0]`, and post-consume bit position.
  Re-exports at the crate root as `Mpeg2DcCoefficient`,
  `Mpeg2DcComponent`, `Mpeg2DcPredictors`, `Mpeg2ColourComponent`,
  `MPEG2_MAX_DC_SIZE`, `mpeg2_decode_dc_block`,
  `mpeg2_dc_pred_reset_value`, and `mpeg2_qfs_zero_max`. 29 new
  lib unit tests + 7 new integration tests under
  `tests/mpeg2_block_dc_synthetic.rs` pin Tables B-12 / B-13's
  cardinality + width invariants, the first-9-rows bit-exact
  match against MPEG-1 Tables B.5a / B.5b, the §7.2.1 ↔ §2.4.3.7
  reconstruction equivalence, the page-77 `dct_dc_size = 3`
  worked example, the size-11 corner values, the Table 7-2 reset
  lookup, the per-component routing (Y / Cb / Cr independence),
  the bitstream-constraint enforcement on both bounds, and the
  bit-position accounting for the shortest (size 0) and longest
  (size 11) B-12 codewords.

- round 26: MPEG-2 §7.3 inverse-scan — `ALTERNATE_SCAN`
  (Figure 7-3 / `scan[1][v][u]`), `ALTERNATE_INVERSE_SCAN`,
  `ZIGZAG_INVERSE_SCAN`, the `scan_table` / `inverse_scan_table`
  flag-driven selectors per `alternate_scan`, the
  `place_coefficient` per-sample writer that mates with the
  round-25 `Mpeg2DctCoeffStep` walker, and the `apply_inverse_scan`
  full §7.3 loop body for callers operating on a pre-flattened
  `QFS[0..64]` list. Figure 7-2 stays single-sourced from the
  MPEG-1 §2.4.4.1 `block_dc::SCAN` matrix; a unit test asserts the
  cell-for-cell equality so any future drift on either side trips
  immediately. Re-exports at the crate root as
  `MPEG2_ALTERNATE_SCAN`, `MPEG2_ALTERNATE_INVERSE_SCAN`,
  `MPEG2_ZIGZAG_INVERSE_SCAN`, `mpeg2_scan_table`,
  `mpeg2_inverse_scan_table`, `mpeg2_place_coefficient`,
  `mpeg2_apply_inverse_scan`. 21 new lib unit tests + 7 new
  integration tests under
  `tests/mpeg2_inverse_scan_synthetic.rs` pin Figures 7-2 / 7-3
  against the printed page 80, the permutation invariant, the
  forward · inverse round-trip in both scans, the §7.3.1
  matrix-download flag invariant, and a synthetic walker replay
  comparing per-coefficient placement against the full-loop body.

### Added

- Clean-room rebuild round 25: MPEG-2 **residual VLC walker** for the
  §6.2.6 block-layer `dct_coeff_first` / `dct_coeff_next` body per
  ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262) §7.2.2 (Annex B Tables **B-14** / **B-15**
  / **B-16**). The MPEG-1 §2.4.3.7 walker in
  [`dct_coeff::DctCoeffStep`] only handled the older Tables B.5c..B.5f
  shape; this round lands the MPEG-2 sibling that §7.2.2.3 explicitly
  notes is different — both in escape encoding and in the per-table
  `end_of_block` codeword.
  - `mpeg2_dct_coeff::TableSelection::from_context(intra_vlc_format,
    macroblock_intra)` — §7.2.2.1 Table 7-3 selector with the four-row
    resolution: `TableZero` (B-14) for `intra_vlc_format = 0` and for
    every non-intra block; `TableOne` (B-15) only when
    `intra_vlc_format = 1` and `macroblock_intra = 1`.
  - `mpeg2_dct_coeff::DctCoeffStep::parse(br, table, position)` — the
    actual walker. Implements §7.2.2.2 NOTE 2 / NOTE 3 — the FIRST-only
    `1s` (1-bit) and NEXT-only `11s` (2-bit) alternates for B-14's
    `(run = 0, level = ±1)`, both honouring the §7.2.2 sign-bit
    contract. Honours the table-dependent `end_of_block` codeword
    (`10` for B-14, `0110` for B-15) and the §7.2.2.3 escape prefix
    `000001` (6 bits).
  - `mpeg2_dct_coeff::CoefficientPosition` enum (`First` / `Next`)
    captures the §7.2.2.2 modification: §7.2.2.2's note clarifies that
    Table B-14 is only modified for the FIRST coefficient of a
    **non-intra** block, since the first coefficient of an intra block
    is the §7.2.1 DC value handled by [`block_dc`]. B-15 therefore
    always enters at `Next`.
  - Table B-16 escape payload: 6-bit `run` (`0..=63`) + 12-bit signed
    `signed_level` (`[-2047, +2047] \ {0}`, two's-complement wire word
    with `0x000` and `0x800` both rejected as the spec's forbidden
    values).
  - Coverage: 24 new unit tests against ISO/IEC 13818-2 Annex B and
    §7.2.2 — Table 7-3 selector matrix, table row counts (B-14 = 112,
    B-15 = 111), per-width codeword bit-width invariants, per-width
    uniqueness, prefix-freeness at FIRST and NEXT for both tables
    (including escape + EoB), round-trip of every B-14 row (224 cases
    counting both signs), round-trip of every B-15 row (222 cases),
    the FIRST-only and NEXT-only `(0, ±1)` disambiguation, both
    table-dependent EoB codewords, Table B-16 escape round-trip
    (positive + negative extremes including `±2047`), the forbidden
    `signed_level = 0` and `signed_level = -2048` wire words, the
    short-buffer error path, the unrecognised-prefix error path, and
    end-to-end block walks against both tables (B-14 non-intra:
    FIRST → NEXT → escape → EoB; B-15 intra: NEXT → NEXT → escape →
    EoB).

  Spec citations refer to ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262) §§7.2.2,
  7.2.2.1 (Table 7-3), 7.2.2.2 (FIRST / NEXT modification), 7.2.2.3
  (escape, Table B-16), 7.2.2.4 (decoder pseudo-code), and Annex B
  Tables B-14 and B-15.

- Clean-room rebuild round 24: §A **8×8 inverse discrete cosine
  transform** (the IDCT stage of Figure 7-1 between §7.4
  inverse-quantisation and the §7.6 macroblock pipeline) with an IEEE
  Std 1180-1990 / P1180/D2 conformance harness against the four
  statistical metrics ISO/IEC 11172-2 Annex A and ISO/IEC 13818-2 §A
  require by reference.
  - `idct::idct_reference_f64` — direct 4-D summation of the §A
    trigonometric identity at `f64` precision; the "infinite
    precision" reference IEEE 1180 specifies as the gold standard.
  - `idct::idct_candidate_f64` — the fast separable 1-D-pass IDCT
    (eight row IDCTs followed by eight column IDCTs) used internally
    by the integer IDCT. Mathematically identical to the direct
    reference; differs only in `f64` rounding order.
  - `idct::idct_8x8` / `idct_8x8_from_i32` — the integer IDCT API the
    downstream §7.6 pipeline consumes: calls `idct_candidate_f64`,
    rounds with the spec's `Round(x)` operator, and saturates the
    9-bit signed pel range `[-256, +255]` per §7.5.
  - Module constants `F_INPUT_MIN` / `F_INPUT_MAX` (12-bit signed,
    `[-2048, 2047]`) and `F_OUTPUT_MIN` / `F_OUTPUT_MAX` (9-bit
    signed, `[-256, 255]`) expose the §7.4.3 input clamp and the §7.5
    output clamp respectively.
  - `tests/idct_p1180_conformance.rs` — IEEE 1180 / P1180/D2
    statistical accuracy test against the bounds staged at
    `docs/video/mpeg12video/idct-accuracy-spec.md` §4: peak error
    `pe ≤ 1`, peak per-position MSE `pmse ≤ 0.06`, overall MSE
    `omse ≤ 0.02`, peak per-position mean error `pme ≤ 0.015`, and
    overall absolute mean error `ome ≤ 0.0015`. Six pseudo-random
    parameter sets (`L ∈ {256, 5, 300}` × both signs, 1024 blocks
    each, deterministic LCG seeds) plus the spec's two deterministic
    edge cases (all-zero coefficient block → all-zero pel block;
    DC-only block → flat pel block).
- Clean-room rebuild round 23: MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / Recommendation
  ITU-T H.262) §7.4 **inverse-quantisation pipeline** — the dequantiser
  stage of Figure 7-1 between §7.3 inverse-scan and the §A.1 IDCT. Lives
  in `src/mpeg2_dequantize.rs`; the MPEG-1 §2.4.4 dequantiser stays in
  `src/dequantize.rs` (the two formulations diverge by spec).
  - `mpeg2_dequantize::intra_dc_mult` — Table 7-4
    `intra_dc_precision → intra_dc_mult` (8 / 4 / 2 / 1), with
    `intra_dc_mult_from_extension` taking the parsed
    `PictureCodingExtension` directly.
  - `mpeg2_dequantize::DEFAULT_INTRA_WEIGHT` /
    `DEFAULT_NON_INTRA_WEIGHT` — the §6.3.7 default `W[0]` / `W[1]`
    matrices (the intra-default mirrors MPEG-1's `intra_quant`; the
    non-intra-default is all-16).
  - `mpeg2_dequantize::select_weighting_matrix_index(coding,
    component, chroma_format)` — Table 7-5 weighting-matrix index
    selection (`w ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}`), folding the 4:2:0 chroma collapse
    into the luma slot and the 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 split out into `w == 2`
    (intra chroma) and `w == 3` (non-intra chroma).
  - `mpeg2_dequantize::QUANTISER_SCALE_LINEAR` /
    `QUANTISER_SCALE_NONLINEAR` — the Table 7-6 lookup arrays for
    `q_scale_type == 0` (linear, `2..=62`) and `q_scale_type == 1`
    (non-linear, `1..=112`); the safe accessor `quantiser_scale(code,
    q_scale_type)` rejects code `0` (forbidden per Table 7-6) and any
    value above the 5-bit range.
  - `mpeg2_dequantize::inverse_quantise_block(qf, coding, weight,
    quantiser_scale, intra_dc_mult)` composes §7.4.1 + §7.4.2.3 +
    §7.4.3 + §7.4.4 into one call: §7.4.1 intra-DC short-circuit at
    `(v, u) == (0, 0)` for `Intra`, §7.4.2.3 reconstruction `((2 *
    QF + k) * W * quantiser_scale) / 32` (`k = 0` for intra, `k =
    Sign(QF)` for non-intra) under the §4.1 round-toward-zero `/`
    operator, §7.4.3 saturation to `[-2048, 2047]`, and §7.4.4
    mismatch control (sum-parity LSB toggle on `F[7][7]`).
    `F_SATURATION_MIN` / `F_SATURATION_MAX` surface the §7.4.3
    clamp bounds; helper functions `sign` / `saturate` expose the
    §4.1 `Sign(...)` and §7.4.3 clamp for callers that want to
    replay the table outside `inverse_quantise_block`.
  - 21 unit tests (Table 7-4 / Table 7-5 / Table 7-6 coverage,
    `Sign`, `Saturate`, and synthetic intra + non-intra walks
    through §7.4.5) + a 7-test integration suite
    (`tests/mpeg2_dequantize_synthetic.rs`) that cross-checks the
    public surface against an independently-coded reference loop
    transcribed from the spec text.
  - Does *not* run the §A.1 IDCT itself (`#1110` IDCT-precision spec
    pending).
- Clean-room rebuild round 22: MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / Recommendation
  ITU-T H.262) §7.6 **Per-macroblock pipeline driver** — the composition
  step that stitches the already-landed §7.6.5 / §7.6.6 case selection,
  §7.6.7 combine-predictions, and §7.6.8 add-and-saturate endpoints into
  a single "parsed-syntax + per-block predictions + per-block IDCT
  output in → final per-coded-block decoded samples out" driver, keyed
  off the parsed `MacroblockType` flags and the §6.3.17.4
  `pattern_code[12]` derivation of `CodedBlockPattern`.
  - `macroblock_pipeline::MacroblockKind { Intra, Inter(direction) }`
    classifies the macroblock per §7.6.5 / §7.6.6 (intra flag
    dominates motion flags; `(forward, backward) = (0, 0)` maps to
    the `Skipped` direction for the §7.6.3.5 implicit zero-MV case),
    and `MacroblockKind::from_macroblock_type` performs the
    classification from a parsed `MacroblockType`.
  - `macroblock_pipeline::BlockInputs` is the per-block payload —
    `transform: &[i16]` plus `prediction_forward: &[u8]` /
    `prediction_backward: &[u8]` — with `BlockInputs::intra` /
    `::forward` / `::backward` / `::bidirectional` constructors that
    leave the unused prediction side(s) empty.
  - `macroblock_pipeline::decode_block(kind, inputs)` is the inner
    driver: for `Intra` it calls `add_intra_block` (§7.6.8 `d =
    saturate(f)` shortcut); for every inter case it calls
    `combine_directional_predictions` then
    `add_prediction_and_coefficients` for the `d = saturate(f + p)`
    `[0, 255]` clamp.
  - `macroblock_pipeline::decode_macroblock(kind, cbp, mt, chroma,
    block_inputs)` is the outer driver: walks
    `pattern_code[0 .. blocks_per_macroblock(chroma)]` and invokes
    `decode_block` per coded slot, returning each `DecodedBlock` with
    its §6.3.17.4 `block_index`. Uncoded slots and out-of-format
    chroma slots are skipped.
  - `macroblock_pipeline::blocks_per_macroblock(chroma)` returns the
    §6.1.1.8 chroma-format block count per MB (6 for 4:2:0, 8 for
    4:2:2, 12 for 4:4:4).
  - `macroblock_pipeline::PipelineError { LengthMismatch,
    MissingForwardPrediction, MissingBackwardPrediction,
    MissingBidirectionalPrediction }` enumerates the four
    caller-bug paths; the driver does not parse bitstreams so an
    `InvalidBitstream` cannot originate here.
  - The driver intentionally does **not** run the §A.1 IDCT (still
    blocked by workspace issue #1110), the §7.6.4 pel reader, the
    `coded_block_pattern()` bitstream walk, or the §6.2.5 macroblock
    layer parsers; each of those is consumed as an input from the
    already-landed pieces in their own modules.
  - 22 new unit tests in `src/macroblock_pipeline.rs` cover the
    `MacroblockKind` classifier (intra overrides motion, four-way
    inter direction map), `decode_block`'s intra bit-equality with
    `add_intra_block` and its prediction-side-ignored property, the
    inter forward / backward / bidirectional / skipped combine-then-
    add arithmetic on 2×2 blocks, the four caller-bug errors,
    `blocks_per_macroblock` for all three chroma formats, and
    `decode_macroblock`'s intra-everywhere walk (6 / 12 blocks per
    MB), inter-only-cbp-bits-walked walk
    (`cbp = 0b101010` → blocks 0 / 2 / 4), skipped-zero-pattern walk
    (zero coded blocks), 4:2:2 walk (8 coded blocks driven by
    `coded_block_pattern_1`), and the error-propagation-on-first-
    failing-block path.
  - 8 new integration tests in `tests/macroblock_pipeline_synthetic.rs`
    drive the pipeline end-to-end on hand-built reference planes and
    fabricated `i16` IDCT outputs for: 4:2:0 intra-everywhere
    (6 blocks); P-forward-only zero-residual (prediction passes
    through unchanged); B-bidirectional with the §7.6.8 clamp engaging
    at both ends; B-backward-only on a single coded block; the
    all-zero `pattern_code[]` skipped MB; the inner `decode_block`
    on a canonical 8×8 intra block; `MissingForwardPrediction`
    propagation; and `blocks_per_macroblock` chroma-format mapping.

- Clean-room rebuild round 21: MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / Recommendation
  ITU-T H.262) §7.6.7 **Combining predictions** + §7.6.8 **Adding
  prediction and coefficient data** — the bidirectional-average step
  that turns the up-to-two §7.6.4 forward / backward prediction blocks
  into the final per-component prediction sample plane, plus the
  prediction-plus-IDCT-plus-saturation reconstruction that produces the
  final decoded samples.
  - `combine_predictions::average_predictions(forward, backward)` and
    its `..._in_place` variant implement the §7.6.7.1 page-105
    formula `pel_pred[y][x] = (pel_pred_forward[y][x] +
    pel_pred_backward[y][x]) // 2` over equal-length `Vec<u8>`
    prediction blocks. The §4.1 `// 2` operator on the non-negative
    sum of two `u8` values is the canonical `(sum + 1) >> 1`
    rounded-up form.
  - `combine_predictions::PredictionDirection { Forward, Backward,
    Bidirectional, Skipped }` captures the four §7.6.5
    Tables 7-13 / 7-14 selection cases, and
    `combine_predictions::combine_directional_predictions(direction,
    forward, backward)` is the driver that returns the combined
    block (single-direction pass-through for `Forward` / `Backward`,
    `average_predictions` for `Bidirectional`, forward pass-through
    for the §7.6.3.5 implicit-zero-MV `Skipped` case).
  - `combine_predictions::average_dual_prime_predictions(same_parity,
    opposite_parity)` is the §7.6.7.4 alias of the same formula —
    arithmetic identical to the bidirectional average, separate name
    for caller readability when wiring §7.6.3.6 dual-prime vectors
    through the §7.6.4 reader.
  - `add_coefficients::saturate(value)` implements the two `if`
    clauses of §7.6.8 page 106 (`d < 0 -> 0`, `d > 255 -> 255`) as a
    single `i32::clamp` returning `u8`.
  - `add_coefficients::add_prediction_and_coefficients(transform,
    prediction)` and its `..._in_place` variant pointwise add the
    §A.1 IDCT output (`i16`) and the §7.6.7 prediction (`u8`) and
    saturate to `[0, 255]`. Geometry-agnostic — the spec writes the
    loop over 8×8 but the operation is intrinsically pointwise.
  - `add_coefficients::add_intra_block(transform)` is the
    intra-macroblock shortcut: no prediction step has run for
    `macroblock_intra == 1`, so the final samples are just
    `saturate(f)` across the IDCT output, equivalent to passing an
    all-zero prediction buffer.
  - 34 new unit tests cover the `// 2` rounding on every relevant
    case (no-tie, half-integer tie, u8 max), the four-way
    `combine_directional_predictions` switch (including length-
    mismatch rejection on the `Bidirectional` branch), the dual-prime
    alias's bit-equality with the bidirectional path, the saturation
    arithmetic at both clamps (`-1 -> 0`, `256 -> 255`, `i32::MIN /
    MAX` extremes), the in-place add and the intra shortcut's
    equivalence to the zero-prediction path. A new
    `tests/combine_add_synthetic.rs` integration test (7 cases)
    drives the full §7.6.4 → §7.6.7 → §7.6.8 chain on hand-crafted
    references for the intra / P-forward / B-bidirectional /
    B-backward / skipped / 8×8 paths, with hand-computed expected
    samples (no external decoder oracle).

- Clean-room rebuild round 20: MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / Recommendation
  ITU-T H.262) §7.6.4 **Forming predictions** — the integer-and-half-pel
  sample reader that turns a fully-reconstructed `vector'[r][s][1:0]`
  into a `width × height` pel-prediction block.
  - `forming_predictions::split_component(vector)` implements the
    per-axis split: `int_vec = vector DIV 2`, `half_flag = (vector -
    2 * int_vec) != 0`. `DIV` is the §4.1 floor-toward-minus-infinity
    operator, so `(-3) DIV 2 = -2` (not `-1` as truncate-toward-zero
    would give); the half-flag is set whenever the original component
    is odd, including for negative odd vectors.
  - `forming_predictions::HalfPattern` enumerates the four
    `(half_flag[0], half_flag[1])` outcomes (`Integer`,
    `HalfHorizontal`, `HalfVertical`, `HalfBoth`) that drive the
    §7.6.4 page-88 four-arm sample-reading switch.
  - `forming_predictions::predict_sample` / `predict_block` apply the
    switch — single sample for the integer case, the `// 2` two-
    sample average for horizontal-or-vertical half-pel, and the
    `// 4` four-sample bilinear average for the diagonal half-pel
    case. The §4.1 round-half-away-from-zero `//` operator on the
    non-negative reference sums coincides with `(sum + d/2) / d`
    integer division.
  - `forming_predictions::ReferencePlane` is a borrowed view
    `(data, width, height)` with a `BoundaryMode::PadEdge` clip-to-
    nearest-in-bounds-sample rule for motion vectors that reach past
    the picture edge; the H.262 base text leaves out-of-picture
    behaviour undefined.
  - `forming_predictions::BlockSize { width, height }` keeps the
    block geometry dimensionless so the §7.6.5 prediction-mode table
    (16×16 frame, 16×8 MC, 16×16 field, 8×8 / 8×16 / 16×16 chroma)
    can drive this loop without per-mode duplication.
  - 38 new unit tests cover the §4.1 `DIV` semantics across the
    sign / parity / magnitude grid, the four `HalfPattern` outcomes
    with their flag round-trip, `ReferencePlane` boundary clamping
    in all four directions plus the corner case, the four-arm
    sample switch with `// 2` and `// 4` rounding (including the
    `(0,1,0,1) // 4 → 1` half-integer-tie case), negative-odd
    vectors that exercise the `DIV`-vs-truncate difference, and
    `predict_block` end-to-end on 2×2 / 4×2 / 3×1 / 1×3 / 4×1
    geometries.

- Clean-room rebuild round 19: MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / Recommendation
  ITU-T H.262) §7.6.3.6 **dual-prime additional arithmetic** — derive
  the opposite-parity motion vector(s) `vector'[r][0][1:0]` from the
  same-parity vector decoded by §7.6.3.1 and the inline `dmvector[0..1]`.
  - `dual_prime::derive_opposite_parity_vector(picture, parity_ref,
    parity_pred, vector_index, decoded_horiz, decoded_vert,
    dmvector_horiz, dmvector_vert)` is the single-row entry point;
    `dual_prime::derive_all(picture, decoded_horiz, decoded_vert,
    dmvector_horiz, dmvector_vert)` is the picture-level driver that
    yields one derived vector for a field picture (`r = 2`) or two
    derived vectors for a frame picture (`r = 2` top, `r = 3` bottom)
    per the §7.6.3.6 page-87 sentence "The top field shall use
    `vector'[2][0][1:0]` for opposite parity prediction and the
    bottom field shall use `vector'[3][0][1:0]`".
  - `dual_prime::m_factor` encodes Table 7-12 (the
    `picture_structure` / `top_field_first`-keyed field-distance
    factor). Frame `tff=1` → `(m[1][0], m[0][1]) = (1, 3)`; `tff=0`
    → `(3, 1)`. Top-field picture → only `m[1][0] = 1`; bottom-field
    picture → only `m[0][1] = 1`. Diagonal cells `m[0][0]` /
    `m[1][1]` are not on Table 7-12 (the same-parity vector is the
    input, not derived) and the function errors when asked for them.
  - `dual_prime::e_offset` encodes Table 7-13 (the unconditional
    vertical-line adjustment between top / bottom fields, picture-
    structure-independent): `e[0][0] = 0`, `e[0][1] = +1`,
    `e[1][0] = -1`, `e[1][1] = 0`.
  - The `//` operator (§4.1 page 9 "integer division with rounding
    to the nearest integer; half-integer values rounded away from
    zero") is honoured for the `(decoded * m) // 2` halving via a
    private helper distinct from `i32::div` (the spec's `/`) and
    `i32::div_euclid` (the spec's `DIV`).
  - `dual_prime::DualPrimePicture` / `dual_prime::dual_prime_picture`
    lower the parser-level `(PictureStructure, top_field_first)` pair
    into a typed context the call site doesn't have to branch on.
  - `dual_prime::FieldParity` (`Top` = 0, `Bottom` = 1) and
    `dual_prime::DerivedDualPrimeVector` (`{parity_ref, parity_pred,
    vector_index, horiz, vert}`) round out the surface.
  - Rejection sites: `dmvector` component outside `{-1, 0, +1}`
    (defensive guard around upstream Table B-11 parsing); any
    `(parity_ref, parity_pred)` pair that isn't on Table 7-12 for the
    active picture type.
  - 19 new unit tests cover the §4.1 `//` examples (`3//2 = 2`,
    `-3//2 = -2`, exact-divisible, `1//2`, `-1//2`, `5//2`, `-5//2`);
    Table 7-12 all four rows; the off-row error paths; Table 7-13 all
    four entries; §7.6.3.6 worked examples for both field-picture
    parities, both frame-picture `tff` values, both `r = 2` and `r =
    3` derivations, the `m = 3` triple-scaling, the swap on `tff =
    0`, the rounding-away-from-zero `decoded = ±3` case under `m =
    1`; out-of-range `dmvector` rejection; the `derive_all` driver's
    one-vs-two output shape; the `dual_prime_picture` lowering for
    all three `PictureStructure` values; and `FieldParity::index` /
    `FieldParity::opposite`.

  consumes the round-17 walker's `dct_zz[]` array and emits the
  `dct_recon[m][n]` matrix the §A.1 IDCT operates on.
  - `dequantize::dequantize_intra_block(dct_zz, quantizer_scale,
    intra_quant, kind, predictors, macroblock_address)` folds the
    four §2.4.4.1 (page 32) block-loops (`LuminanceFirst`,
    `LuminanceSubsequent`, `ChrominanceCb`, `ChrominanceCr` via
    `dequantize::IntraBlockKind`) into a single entry-point. The
    shared body applies the `2 * dct_zz[scan[m][n]] *
    quantizer_scale * intra_quant[m][n] / 16` numerator, the `if
    (recon & 1) == 0 -> recon -= Sign(recon)` even-mismatch rule,
    and the `[-2048, 2047]` saturating clip. The DC element
    `dct_recon[0][0]` is then overwritten per the block-kind
    branch: `LuminanceFirst` / `ChrominanceCb` / `ChrominanceCr`
    pick between `128*8 + dct_zz[0]*8` (when `macroblock_address -
    past_intra_address > 1`) and `dct_dc_<comp>_past +
    dct_zz[0]*8`; `LuminanceSubsequent` is unconditional
    `dct_dc_y_past + dct_zz[0]*8`. The matching `dct_dc_<comp>_past`
    field of `IntraDcPredictors` is updated in place.
  - `dequantize::IntraDcPredictors` holds the three per-component
    `dct_dc_*_past` chains and `past_intra_address`.
    `at_slice_start()` returns the §2.4.4.1 slice-start state (all
    1024, `past_intra_address = -2`). `reset_dc_to_default()`
    zeros the three predictors back to 1024 without touching
    `past_intra_address` — the spec's per-non-intra-macroblock
    reset (including skipped macroblocks).
    `dequantize::finalise_intra_macroblock(predictors,
    macroblock_address)` performs the per-macroblock
    `past_intra_address = macroblock_address` close-out.
  - `dequantize::dequantize_non_intra_block(dct_zz,
    quantizer_scale, non_intra_quant)` implements the §2.4.4.2
    page-35 body: numerator is `(2*dct_zz[i] + Sign(dct_zz[i])) *
    quantizer_scale * non_intra_quant[m][n]`, then the same
    even-mismatch + saturation pipeline, then a final `if
    (dct_zz[i] == 0) dct_recon[m][n] = 0;` zeroing pass. There is
    no DC predictor chain for non-intra blocks.
  - `dequantize::DEFAULT_INTRA_QUANT` and
    `dequantize::DEFAULT_NON_INTRA_QUANT` are the §2.4.3.2 page-25
    default matrices used when the sequence header sets the
    matching `load_*_quantizer_matrix == 0`.
    `DEFAULT_INTRA_QUANT[0][0] == 8` matches the spec's
    `intra_quant[0][0] = 8` requirement; every entry of
    `DEFAULT_NON_INTRA_QUANT` is 16.
  - Rejection sites: `quantizer_scale == 0` and `> 31` are
    rejected with `Error::InvalidBitstream` (§2.4.3.6, defensive),
    and any zero entry in the active `intra_quant` /
    `non_intra_quant` matrix is rejected (§2.4.3.2 "The value zero
    is forbidden.").
  - Public re-exports from the crate root:
    `dequantize_intra_block`, `dequantize_non_intra_block`,
    `finalise_intra_macroblock`, `IntraBlockKind`,
    `IntraDcPredictors`, `DCT_RECON_MAX`, `DCT_RECON_MIN`,
    `DC_PREDICTOR_RESET`, `DEFAULT_INTRA_QUANT`,
    `DEFAULT_NON_INTRA_QUANT`.
- 35 new unit tests in `src/dequantize.rs::tests`: default
  matrices (corners, `intra_quant[0][0] = 8`, all-16 non-intra),
  predictor reset (slice-start, per-non-intra-macroblock),
  `Sign(...)` primitive, even-mismatch rule (no-op on odd, ±1
  correction on even of both signs, zero left alone), saturation
  at both bounds, intra rejection of `quantizer_scale = 0` / `>
  31` / `intra_quant[i][j] = 0`, the slice-start zero-`dct_zz`
  walkthrough that fires the reset branch, the adjacent-vs-gap
  `past_intra_address` branches for `LuminanceFirst`,
  `LuminanceSubsequent` ignoring `past_intra_address`, Cb / Cr
  predictor isolation, the `finalise_intra_macroblock` close-out,
  intra AC worked examples (positive-even subtract-sign,
  negative-even add-sign, saturation at both bounds), non-intra
  rejection sites, all-zero `dct_zz` → all-zero recon, positive
  and negative non-intra worked examples (`+3` → 55, `-3` → -55),
  non-intra saturation, the zeroing-pass override at zero
  neighbours, the full four-luma + Cb + Cr intra-macroblock walk
  with isolated per-component predictor advance, and a
  second-macroblock walk that confirms the address-gap branch
  switches correctly between reset and chain.
- 2 new black-box integration tests at
  `tests/dequantize_synthetic.rs` chain the round-17
  `DctCoeffStep` walker directly into the round-18 dequantiser:
  one non-intra (FIRST `(0, +3)` + NEXT `(2, -1)` + EoB → spec
  closed form `+55` / `-23` at the matching `INVERSE_SCAN` cells)
  and one intra (synthetic `dct_zz[0] = +5` DC prelude + NEXT
  `(0, +3)` + EoB → `1064` reset-branch DC and `+47` AC).
- Crate-level docstring + `register()` docstring updated to
  mention the round-18 dequantiser landing; the function is still
  a no-op because the §A.1 IDCT and motion-compensation
  pel-prediction loops are still ahead.

- Clean-room rebuild round 17: MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993) residual
  block `dct_coeff_first` / `dct_coeff_next` walker — the
  zig-zag-coded run-level body that follows the round 16 DC prelude
  (intra blocks) or replaces it (non-intra blocks).
  - `dct_coeff::DctCoeffStep::parse(br, position)` walks Annex B
    Tables B.5c / B.5d / B.5e (the run-level codebook) longest-first
    across all code widths from 1 to 16 bits, matches the
    `(run, level)` pair, then reads the trailing 1-bit sign `s` and
    applies it to produce the signed `dct_zz[i]` coefficient to write
    at the §2.4.3.7 zig-zag position (`i = run` for FIRST,
    `i += run + 1` for NEXT).
  - `dct_coeff::CoefficientPosition { First, Next }` disambiguates
    the spec's two `(run = 0, level = 1)` codes: `dct_coeff_first`
    uses the 2-bit `1s` form (legal only as the first coefficient of
    a non-intra block); `dct_coeff_next` uses the 3-bit `11s` form.
    The `end_of_block` codeword `10` is accepted only at `Next` per
    Table B.5c note 2 — FIRST decoding `10` returns the `1s` form
    instead.
  - Table B.5f escape coverage: the 6-bit `000001` prefix is followed
    by a 6-bit `run` (1..=63) and an 8-bit signed-level word; the
    short form covers `level ∈ [-127, +127] \ {0}` directly, and the
    long form (8-bit prefix `0x80` for negative or `0x00` for
    positive plus a second 8-bit magnitude byte) extends the range to
    `[-255, -128]` and `[+128, +255]`. The forbidden `-256` and the
    forbidden long-form positive `< 128` (which the short form
    already covers) are rejected. The escape encoding is
    intentionally **not** the same as MPEG-2 Table B-16 — the spec
    text in ISO/IEC 13818-2 §7.2.2.3 explicitly notes the change.
  - `dct_coeff::DctCoeff` is the decoded symbol: either
    `RunLevel { run, signed_level, escape }` (with the `escape`
    field recording whether the symbol came through the Table B.5f
    path) or `EndOfBlock`.
  - `dct_coeff::MAX_RUN = 63` and `dct_coeff::MAX_LEVEL_MAG = 255`
    document the spec bounds for both VLC and escape forms.
  - 31 unit tests cover: every Table B.5c / B.5d / B.5e row parsed
    and round-tripped with both signs (across all 112 ordinary
    rows × 2 signs); per-width prefix-freeness and code-fit-width
    invariants; FIRST-vs-NEXT `(0, 1)` disambiguation; EoB
    recognition only at NEXT; Table B.5f short form including the
    `±127` corner; Table B.5f long form for both signs (`-128`,
    `-255`, `+128`, `+200`, `+255`); rejection of the forbidden
    `-256` and forbidden long-form-positive-below-128 encodings;
    truncated and empty buffer rejection; and bit-position
    accounting across every code width from the 2-bit FIRST form to
    the 17-bit B.5e maximum.
  - 2 new black-box integration tests synthesise complete MPEG-1
    residual block runs (FIRST + several NEXT including a B.5f
    escape, then `end_of_block`) and confirm the §2.4.3.7
    zig-zag-position update never exceeds 63 plus the running bit
    cursor lines up exactly with the encoded bit lengths.

- Clean-room rebuild round 16: MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993) intra-block
  DC prelude — the entry point of the residual block layer.
  - `block_dc::DcCoefficient::parse(br, component)` walks Annex B
    Table B.5a (`dct_dc_size_luminance`) or Table B.5b
    (`dct_dc_size_chrominance`) for the size VLC, then reads the
    `dct_dc_size`-wide `dct_dc_differential` field MSB-first per
    §2.4.2.8 and applies the §2.4.3.7 sign-extension formula
    (`if (raw & (1 << (size-1))) zz0 = raw; else zz0 = ((-1) << size)
    | (raw + 1)`) to produce the signed `dct_zz[0]` in the range
    `[-(2^size - 1), +(2^size - 1)]`.
  - `block_dc::DcComponent { Luminance, Chrominance }` selects the
    matching VLC table.
  - `block_dc::SCAN: [[u8; 8]; 8]` encodes the §2.4.4.1 page-32 8x8
    zig-zag `scan[m][n]` matrix that maps a (zig-zag-ordered) cell
    to its raster index `i` for the §2.4.4.1 dequantiser loop.
    `block_dc::INVERSE_SCAN: [(u8, u8); 64]` is the compile-time
    inverse for encoders / trace tools.
  - `block_dc::MAX_DC_SIZE = 8` documents the spec upper bound
    enforced by both tables.
  - 23 unit tests cover: every B.5a / B.5b row, code-width
    uniqueness, codes-fit-their-width invariants, the §2.4.3.7
    page-30 worked example (`dc_size = 3`: `000 → -7, 001 → -6, ...
    111 → +7`), the `dc_size = 1 / 2 / 8` corner values
    (`reconstruct(8, 0x00) == -255`, `reconstruct(8, 0xFF) == +255`),
    truncated-buffer / garbage-prefix detection, luminance-vs-
    chrominance table disambiguation on identical wire bits
    (`'00'` decodes as size 1 in B.5a but size 0 in B.5b), full
    bit-position tracking on size 0 (3 bits) vs size 8 (15 bits),
    and the §2.4.4.1 `SCAN` matrix's spec corners
    (`scan[0][0] = 0`, `scan[7][7] = 63`), its zig-zag diagonal
    opening (`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` mapping), and the
    `SCAN` / `INVERSE_SCAN` round-trip.

- Clean-room rebuild round 15: MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993) §2.4.4.2
  / §2.4.4.3 motion-vector reconstruction — the bridge from the round
  14 parser's `(code, r)` pairs to the integer `right_for / down_for`
  offsets the §2.4.4.2 pel-prediction equations consume.
  - `mpeg1_reconstruct::reconstruct(mv, ctx, &mut predictor,
    direction)` runs the §2.4.4.2 four-step formula (`r_size` / `f`
    derivation, `complement_*_r` derivation, `*_little` / `*_big`
    arithmetic, PMV update with wrap-around to `[-16*f, 16*f-1]`,
    then the optional `full_pel_*_vector << 1` shift on the recon
    output).
  - `Mpeg1Predictor { recon_right_prev, recon_down_prev }` carries
    the half-sample-unit PMV across consecutive predictive
    macroblocks. `Mpeg1Predictor::reset()` zeroes it at the
    start-of-slice and at the §2.4.4.2 ¶3 P-picture "no MV" case.
  - `mpeg1_reconstruct::reconstruct_zero(&mut predictor)` — the
    §2.4.4.2 ¶3 P-picture "no forward MV data" path: zeroes both
    the returned recon and the predictor.
  - `mpeg1_reconstruct::reconstruct_absent(ctx, &predictor)` — the
    §2.4.4.3 B-picture "no MV data" carry-over: recon = predictor
    unchanged (in contrast to the P-picture zero-reset).
  - `Mpeg1FrameMvContext { f_code, full_pel }` packages the picture
    header's `<dir>_f_code` and `full_pel_<dir>_vector` fields the
    reconstruction needs in addition to the parsed element.
  - `Mpeg1ReconstructedMv` exposes the §2.4.4.2 closing table's
    split: `(recon_right, recon_down)` plus the luminance
    (`right_for_luma = recon_right >> 1`, `right_half_for_luma`)
    and chrominance (`right_for_chroma = (recon_right / 2) >> 1`,
    `right_half_for_chroma = recon_right / 2 - 2 *
    right_for_chroma`) whole / half-pel pairs. Luma uses arithmetic
    `>>` (floored); chroma uses C-style `/` (truncated toward
    zero) — the spec's bit-exact divergence on negative values is
    preserved.
  - §2.4.4.2 conformance guards on `*_little != ±forward_f * 16`
    are enforced (both seam values rejected as
    `Error::InvalidBitstream`).
  - 23 new unit tests pinning every documented branch (`f_code`
    1/2 paths, complement zero / nonzero, positive / negative
    codes, PMV accumulation, wrap in both directions, `full_pel`
    shift, both seam guards, all input-validation sites, the
    P-picture zero-reset, the B-picture carry-over, and the luma
    / chroma half-pel split for both positive and negative
    `recon_*` values).
  - 2 new black-box integration tests
    (`tests/mpeg1_reconstruct_synthetic.rs`) against a
    hand-assembled two-macroblock bitstream — parse via
    `Mpeg1MotionVector::parse` then reconstruct end-to-end,
    asserting PMV propagation.
  - Re-exports `Mpeg1FrameMvContext`, `Mpeg1Predictor`,
    `Mpeg1ReconstructedMv`, `mpeg1_reconstruct`,
    `mpeg1_reconstruct_zero`, and `mpeg1_reconstruct_absent` at the
    crate root.
  - The §2.4.4.2 pel-prediction loop itself (the bilinear half-pel
    filter against `pel_past[][]` / `pel_future[][]`) is the
    next-round concern — it needs a reference-picture buffer the
    decoder doesn't yet allocate.
- Clean-room rebuild round 14: MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993)
  `motion_vector(s)` parser per §2.4.2.7 with the §2.4.3.6 field
  semantics, driven by Annex B Table B.4 (`motion_*_code` VLC). The
  parser lands the four-field wire shape (`motion_horizontal_*_code`,
  `motion_horizontal_*_r`, `motion_vertical_*_code`,
  `motion_vertical_*_r`) for the forward and backward directions
  selected by `Mpeg1MotionDirection`, with the residual gate
  `<dir>_f != 1 && motion_*_code != 0` and the
  `<dir>_r_size = <dir>_f_code - 1` width rule.
  - `mpeg1_motion_vector::Mpeg1MotionVector::parse(br, direction,
    f_code)` consumes the spec-mandated bits and returns a typed
    record with the bit cursor position immediately after the
    element.
  - `mpeg1_motion_vector::Mpeg1MotionDirection { Forward, Backward }`
    parameterises the parse on which `<dir>_f_code` /
    `full_pel_<dir>_vector` family applies.
  - Table B.4's 33 codeword → signed value rows are decoded via a
    new `pub(crate) motion_vector::match_motion_code` accessor that
    reuses the existing longest-first walker (MPEG-1 Table B.4 and
    MPEG-2 Annex B Table B-10 share the same numerical mapping
    row-for-row).
  - `f_code` range guard: `1..=7` per §2.4.3.4; zero is rejected as
    "forbidden", values `≥ 8` as outside the spec's range.
  - 20 new unit tests pinning every Table B.4 row to its tabulated
    bit width + signed value, plus the §2.4.3.6 presence matrix
    (residual gated on `f_code != 1 && code != 0`), the widest
    `r_size = 6` case for `f_code = 7`, mixed/zero/non-zero
    component combos, truncated-residual short-buffer detection,
    invalid-prefix detection, and the `Backward` direction tag.
  - Re-exports `Mpeg1MotionDirection`, `Mpeg1MotionVector` at the
    crate root.
  - §2.4.4.2 / §2.4.4.3 reconstruction (`recon_right_for_*` /
    `recon_down_for_*` with the `full_pel_*_vector` shift and the
    "right_little / right_big" wrap-around) is deferred to the next
    round, mirroring the MPEG-2 split between §6.2.5.2 (parser) and
    §7.6.3.1 (reconstruction).
- Clean-room rebuild round 13: §7.6.3.3 inter-vector PMV update
  (Tables 7-10 / 7-11), the once-per-macroblock pass that follows
  motion-vector reconstruction and propagates the `[r = 0]` PMV slot
  into the `[r = 1]` slot (or zeroes every slot) so prediction modes
  with fewer-than-maximum vectors still leave a sensible `PMV[1]`
  behind.
  - `pmv::update_predictors(&mut Pmv, PmvUpdateContext)` driving
    Tables 7-10 (frame pictures) and 7-11 (field pictures). The two
    tables share the right-hand "Predictors to Update" column
    row-for-row; the implementation branches on `picture_structure`
    + `prediction_type` to pick the right row family then applies
    the (fwd, bwd, intra) sub-cell.
  - Intra path covers both the `‡` row (`Frame-based`/`Field-based`
    assumed when `frame_motion_type` / `field_motion_type` is absent
    from the bitstream) and the `◊` footnote (when
    `concealment_motion_vectors == 0` the entire PMV is reset per
    §7.6.3.4 instead of copying `[0][0][1:0]` into `[1][0][1:0]`).
  - Non-intra Frame-based / Field-based / 16x8 MC / Dual-Prime row
    coverage including the `§` zero-motion footnote (PMV reset, only
    reachable in a P-picture) and the Dual-Prime forward-copy row.
  - Cells the spec leaves unreachable are rejected:
    `InvalidBitstream` for intra-with-motion-flag, Frame-based in a
    field picture, 16x8 MC in a frame picture, Dual-Prime with
    backward motion, Field-based / 16x8 with both motion flags zero,
    and non-intra without motion-type code.
  - `PmvUpdateOutcome` enum labels which row fired
    (`IntraConcealmentCopyForwardFirst`, `IntraResetAll`,
    `NonIntraCopyForward`, `NonIntraCopyBackward`,
    `NonIntraCopyBoth`, `NonIntraZeroMotionReset`, `NoUpdate`,
    `DualPrimeCopyForward`).
  - 18 new unit tests pinning every row of Tables 7-10 / 7-11 to a
    bit-exact PMV outcome, plus an end-to-end
    `reconstruct_motion_vector → update_predictors` chain
    confirming the reconstructed (3, -2) vector propagates from
    `PMV[0][0][:]` into `PMV[1][0][:]`.
  - Re-exports `update_predictors`, `PmvUpdateContext`,
    `PmvUpdateOutcome` at the crate root alongside the existing
    `Pmv` family.
- Clean-room rebuild round 1: parser for the MPEG-2 (ITU-T H.262 /
  ISO/IEC 13818-2) `sequence_header()` syntax element (§6.2.2.1)
  with field semantics from §6.3.3:
  - Start-code `0x000001B3` validation.
  - 12-bit horizontal/vertical size values (forbidden zero rejected).
  - 4-bit `aspect_ratio_information` decoded against Table 6-3.
  - 4-bit `frame_rate_code` (Table 6-4; forbidden zero rejected).
  - 18-bit `bit_rate_value` (forbidden zero rejected),
    `marker_bit` enforcement, 10-bit `vbv_buffer_size_value`,
    `constrained_parameters_flag`.
  - Optional `intra_quantiser_matrix[64]` and
    `non_intra_quantiser_matrix[64]` loads.
- Typed `Mpeg2SequenceHeader` and `AspectRatio` enums (re-exported
  at the crate root).
- 12 unit tests + 1 black-box integration test against an
  `ffmpeg`-produced 352×240 MPEG-2 elementary stream.
- Clean-room rebuild round 2: parser for `sequence_extension()`
  (§6.2.2.3) with field semantics from §6.3.5.
  - `extension_start_code` `0x000001B5` + 4-bit
    `extension_start_code_identifier == '0001'` Sequence Extension
    ID (Table 6-2) validation.
  - 8-bit `profile_and_level_indication` (raw byte),
    `progressive_sequence` flag, 2-bit `chroma_format`
    decoded against Table 6-5 (reserved `00` rejected).
  - 2-bit `horizontal_size_extension`, 2-bit
    `vertical_size_extension`, 12-bit `bit_rate_extension`,
    `marker_bit` enforcement, 8-bit `vbv_buffer_size_extension`,
    `low_delay`, 2-bit `frame_rate_extension_n`, 5-bit
    `frame_rate_extension_d`.
- Composed-view helper `Mpeg2Sequence::from_buf` that parses a
  `sequence_header()` + `next_start_code()` zero-byte stuffing
  (§5.2.3) + `sequence_extension()` pair and synthesises the
  14-bit `horizontal_size`, 14-bit `vertical_size`, 30-bit
  `bit_rate`, and 18-bit `vbv_buffer_size`. Composite
  `bit_rate == 0` rejected per §6.3.3.
- Typed `Mpeg2SequenceExtension`, `ChromaFormat`, and
  `Mpeg2Sequence` (re-exported at the crate root).
- 12 new unit tests + 2 new black-box integration tests against
  the existing 352×240 fixture (extension decode + composed
  `Mpeg2Sequence` round-trip).
- Clean-room rebuild round 3: parser for
  `group_of_pictures_header()` (§6.2.2.6) with field semantics
  from §6.3.8.
  - `group_start_code` = `0x000001B8` validation.
  - 25-bit `time_code` decomposition per Table 6-11:
    1-bit `drop_frame_flag`, 5-bit `time_code_hours` (0..=23),
    6-bit `time_code_minutes` (0..=59), 1-bit `marker_bit`
    enforcement, 6-bit `time_code_seconds` (0..=59), 6-bit
    `time_code_pictures` (0..=59).
  - 1-bit `closed_gop` and 1-bit `broken_link` flags.
- Typed `Mpeg2Gop` + `TimeCode` (re-exported at the crate root).
- 11 new unit tests + 1 new black-box integration test against
  the existing 352×240 fixture (locates the GOP start code,
  decodes the time-code, asserts `closed_gop = 1`,
  `broken_link = 0`).
- Clean-room rebuild round 4: parser for `picture_header()`
  (§6.2.3) with field semantics from §6.3.10.
  - `picture_start_code` = `0x00000100` validation.
  - 10-bit `temporal_reference`, 3-bit `picture_coding_type`
    decoded against Table 6-12 (forbidden / D-picture /
    reserved codes rejected), 16-bit `vbv_delay`.
  - Conditional 1-bit `full_pel_forward_vector` + 3-bit
    `forward_f_code` for P / B pictures.
  - Conditional 1-bit `full_pel_backward_vector` + 3-bit
    `backward_f_code` for B pictures.
  - `extra_information_picture` byte loop captured as raw
    `Vec<u8>` (empty for every conforming MPEG-2 stream).
- Parser for `picture_coding_extension()` (§6.2.3.1) with field
  semantics from §6.3.11.
  - `extension_start_code` `0x000001B5` + 4-bit Picture Coding
    Extension ID `1000` (Table 6-2) validation.
  - Four 4-bit `f_code[s][t]` sub-fields with the §6.3.11
    forbidden-zero guard.
  - 2-bit `intra_dc_precision` (Table 6-13) and 2-bit
    `picture_structure` (Table 6-14; reserved `00` rejected).
  - 10 trailing single-bit flags from `top_field_first` through
    `composite_display_flag`.
- Composed-view helper `Mpeg2PictureHeader::parse_with_extension`
  that parses `picture_header()` + `next_start_code()`
  zero-byte stuffing (§5.2.3) + `picture_coding_extension()`.
- Typed `Mpeg2PictureHeader`, `PictureCodingType`,
  `PictureCodingExtension`, `PictureStructure` (re-exported at
  the crate root); `PICTURE_START_CODE` /
  `PICTURE_CODING_EXTENSION_ID` constants.
- 18 new unit tests + 2 new black-box integration tests against
  the existing 352×240 fixture (picture-header parse +
  picture_header + picture_coding_extension composition).
- Clean-room rebuild round 5: parser for the `slice()` header bits
  (§6.2.4) with field semantics from §6.3.16.
  - 32-bit `slice_start_code`: 24-bit prefix `0x000001` + 8-bit
    `slice_vertical_position` validated against the Table 6-1
    range `0x01..=0xAF`.
  - Optional 3-bit `slice_vertical_position_extension`, present
    iff the caller's `SliceContext::vertical_size` is `> 2800`
    (§6.2.4); §6.3.16's stricter `svp ∈ [1:128]` constraint
    enforced when the extension is present.
  - Optional 7-bit `priority_breakpoint`, gated on the caller's
    `SliceContext::priority_breakpoint_present` (caller derives
    from `sequence_scalable_extension()`, not yet parsed by this
    crate).
  - 5-bit `quantiser_scale_code` with the spec-defined
    forbidden-zero check (§6.3.16).
  - Optional intra-slice prelude: `intra_slice_flag` /
    `intra_slice` / 7-bit `reserved_bits` (enforced `== 0`) plus
    the `extra_information_slice` byte loop driven by the same
    `nextbits() == '1'` mechanism used for
    `extra_information_picture`. Final `extra_bit_slice` bit
    enforced `== '0'`.
  - `SliceHeader::mb_row()` helper computes `mb_row` per
    §6.3.16: `(extension << 7) + svp - 1` when the extension is
    present, `svp - 1` otherwise.
  - `body_bit_position` field gives the bit offset (from the start
    of the slice buffer) at which the first `macroblock()` begins
    — the macroblock body itself is **not** in scope for round 5.
- Typed `SliceHeader` + `SliceContext` (re-exported at the crate
  root) plus `SLICE_VERTICAL_POSITION_MIN` /
  `SLICE_VERTICAL_POSITION_MAX` constants.
- 14 new unit tests covering every spec-defined rejection site
  (wrong prefix, svp = 0, svp = 0xB0, svp > 128 with extension,
  zero `quantiser_scale_code`, non-zero `reserved_bits`,
  truncated buffer) plus the intra-slice prelude /
  `extra_information_slice` round-trip and bit-position
  accounting.
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture (first slice header at offset `0x2e`,
  slice-start-code multiplicity sanity check).
- Clean-room rebuild round 6: parser for
  `macroblock_address_increment` (§6.2.5) with field semantics
  from §6.3.17.1 and the Annex B Table B-1 VLC.
  - 33 increment-value codewords (`1..=33`) walked MSB-first
    against the spec's tabulated bit-strings (1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 7-,
    8-, 10-, and 11-bit code groups).
  - `macroblock_escape` (`0000 0001 000`, 11 bits) consumption
    with the §6.3.17.1 "add 33 per escape" chain rule (caller
    receives the consumed escape count for spec-bound validation
    against `mb_width × (mb_height − mb_row)`).
  - Optional MPEG-1 `macroblock_stuffing` (`0000 0001 111`)
    recognition, gated on `MbAddressIncrementContext::mpeg1` per
    ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993 §D.5.5.1. MPEG-2 streams (the default
    context) reject the stuffing code as a §6.3.17.1 violation;
    stuffing after an escape is rejected in both contexts.
  - Typed `MbAddressIncrement { value, escape_count,
    stuffing_count, bit_position_after }` (re-exported at the
    crate root) plus the `MbAddressIncrementContext` helper
    (`mpeg1()` / `mpeg2()`).
- 16 new unit tests covering every Table B-1 entry (parsed
  individually), the escape chain (`33 + N`, `66`, `70` worked
  example from §D.5.5.2), spec-mandated stuffing rejection in
  MPEG-2, MPEG-1 stuffing acceptance, stuffing-after-escape
  rejection, garbage-prefix rejection, truncated-buffer
  handling, bit-position accounting, and Table B-1 internal
  invariants (33 values + escape + stuffing, no width-collisions,
  every code fits its declared bit width).
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: parses the first `macroblock_address_increment`
  immediately after the first slice header (expected `value = 1`,
  the single bit `'1'`) and confirms the fixture does not emit
  the MPEG-1-only stuffing code.
- Clean-room rebuild round 7: parser for `macroblock_type` — the
  leading VLC of `macroblock_modes()` (§6.2.5.1) with field
  semantics from §6.3.17.1 and the non-scalable Annex B
  Tables B-2 / B-3 / B-4.
  - Table selection by `picture_coding_type` per Table 6-10
    (no `sequence_scalable_extension()`): B-2 for I-pictures,
    B-3 for P-pictures, B-4 for B-pictures.
  - All 2 + 7 + 11 codewords walked MSB-first longest-first,
    decoding the six §6.3.17.1 derived flags `macroblock_quant`,
    `macroblock_motion_forward`, `macroblock_motion_backward`,
    `macroblock_pattern`, `macroblock_intra`, and
    `spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag` (always `0` for the
    non-scalable tables).
  - The rest of `macroblock_modes()`
    (`spatial_temporal_weight_code`, `frame_motion_type` /
    `field_motion_type`, `dct_type`) and the macroblock body
    remain out of scope.
- Typed `MacroblockType { macroblock_quant,
  macroblock_motion_forward, macroblock_motion_backward,
  macroblock_pattern, macroblock_intra,
  spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag, bit_position_after }`
  (re-exported at the crate root).
- 13 new unit tests covering every Table B-2 / B-3 / B-4 row
  (parsed individually), longest-first prefix disambiguation,
  unknown-codeword and truncated-buffer rejection, and per-table
  invariants (codes fit their declared width, every table is
  prefix-free, row counts match Annex B).
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: the first I-picture macroblock's `macroblock_type`
  decodes to plain `Intra` (single-bit Table B-2 code `'1'`) and
  advances the cursor by exactly one bit past the increment.
- Clean-room rebuild round 8: parser for `coded_block_pattern()`
  (§6.2.5.3) with field semantics from §6.3.17.4 and the Annex B
  Table B-9 variable-length codes.
  - All 64 `coded_block_pattern_420` codewords (3- to 9-bit)
    walked MSB-first longest-first against the spec's tabulated
    bit-strings, decoding to the 6-bit `cbp` (0..=63).
  - 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 chroma extensions: 2-bit `coded_block_pattern_1`
    and 6-bit `coded_block_pattern_2` fixed-length codes read when
    the caller-supplied `chroma_format` selects them.
  - `CodedBlockPattern::pattern_code(macroblock_intra,
    macroblock_pattern)` derives the 12-entry `pattern_code[i]`
    array per §6.3.17.4 (intra-default all-ones, then `cbp` /
    `coded_block_pattern_1` / `coded_block_pattern_2` masking).
  - Typed `CodedBlockPattern { cbp, coded_block_pattern_1,
    coded_block_pattern_2, bit_position_after }` (re-exported at
    the crate root).
- 19 new unit tests covering every Table B-9 row (parsed
  individually), all-64-cbp coverage, longest-first prefix
  disambiguation, the 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 extensions, the §6.3.17.4
  `pattern_code` derivation, unknown-codeword / truncated-buffer
  rejection, and table invariants (prefix-free, widths fit,
  64 rows).
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: the first I-picture macroblock is plain `Intra`
  (`macroblock_pattern = 0`, so no `coded_block_pattern()` per
  §6.2.5.3), and the fixture's chroma is pinned to 4:2:0 before
  decoding a Table B-9 codeword against it.
- Clean-room rebuild round 9: parser for the macroblock-layer
  `quantizer_scale` per ISO/IEC 11172-2:1993 (MPEG-1 Video)
  §2.4.2.7 (syntax) with field semantics from §2.4.3.6. Fills the
  bitstream gap between round 7's `macroblock_type` and round 8's
  `coded_block_pattern()` — `quantizer_scale` is read immediately
  after `macroblock_type`, conditional on the `macroblock_quant`
  flag the type carries.
  - When `macroblock_quant` is set, a 5-bit `quantizer_scale` is
    read and validated against the §2.4.3.6 range `1..=31` (the
    value `0` is forbidden).
  - When `macroblock_quant` is clear the field is absent: zero bits
    are read and `quantizer_scale = None` is returned, matching the
    §2.4.3.6 persistence rule (the decoder keeps the value
    established at the slice layer or a prior macroblock).
  - `QuantizerScale::parse_after_type(br, &MacroblockType)`
    convenience threads the flag straight from a decoded
    `macroblock_type`.
  - Typed `QuantizerScale { quantizer_scale, bit_position_after }`
    (re-exported at the crate root) plus `QUANTIZER_SCALE_MIN` /
    `QUANTIZER_SCALE_MAX` constants.
- 12 new unit tests covering the present / absent branches, every
  legal value `1..=31`, forbidden-zero rejection, truncated- and
  empty-buffer handling on both branches, `parse_after_type`
  flag-threading for both flag states, the bound constants, and
  bit-position accounting.
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: the first I-picture macroblock is plain `Intra`
  (`macroblock_quant = 0`), so per §2.4.2.7 it carries no
  `quantizer_scale` and the parser consumes zero bits; a spliced
  `macroblock_quant`-set `macroblock_type` then decodes a synthetic
  5-bit `quantizer_scale` with correct value and bit accounting.
- Clean-room rebuild round 10: parser for the remainder of
  `macroblock_modes()` after `macroblock_type` per ISO/IEC 13818-2
  (ITU-T H.262) §6.2.5.1 with field semantics from §6.3.17.1 /
  §6.3.17.2 and the meaning Tables 6-17, 6-18 and 6-19. Closes
  `macroblock_modes()`; `motion_vectors()` and the block loop stay
  out of scope.
  - 2-bit `frame_motion_type` (Table 6-17) / `field_motion_type`
    (Table 6-18) decoding, surfacing the derived `prediction_type`,
    `motion_vector_count`, `mv_format`, and `dmv`; reserved code
    `00` rejected; the two `Field-based` rows of Table 6-17 split by
    a caller-supplied `spatial_temporal_weight_class`.
  - §6.2.5.1 presence gates honoured: the motion-type code is read
    only when a motion flag is set (omitted in frame pictures when
    `frame_pred_frame_dct == 1`), and `dct_type` only when
    `picture_structure == frame`, `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0`, and
    the macroblock is intra or has a coded pattern. Absent fields
    read zero bits.
  - `spatial_temporal_weight_code` is not read (scalable-only,
    `spatial_temporal_weight_code_flag` is always `0` for the
    non-scalable tables); a `mb_type` claiming the flag is rejected.
  - Typed `MacroblockModesTail { motion_type, dct_type,
    bit_position_after }`, `MotionType`, `PredictionType`,
    `MvFormat`, and `MacroblockModesContext` (re-exported at the
    crate root).
- 21 new unit tests covering every Table 6-17 / 6-18 row, the
  per-class `Field-based` vector-count split, reserved-code
  rejection, the motion-type / `dct_type` presence matrix, the
  scalable-flag rejection, zero-bit absent paths, and truncated-
  buffer handling.
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: a full slice → increment → type → quantizer_scale →
  `macroblock_modes()` tail chain on the first I-picture macroblock
  (motion-type absent; `dct_type` presence keyed to the fixture's
  own `frame_pred_frame_dct`), plus a spliced P-picture frame
  macroblock decoding `frame_motion_type` + `dct_type` with exact
  bit accounting.

- Clean-room rebuild round 11: parsers for the `motion_vectors(s)`
  wrapper per ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262) §6.2.5.2 and the inner
  `motion_vector(r, s)` per §6.2.5.2.1, with field semantics from
  §6.3.17.2 / §6.3.17.3 and the Annex B Tables B-10 (`motion_code`)
  and B-11 (`dmvector`). The numerical reconstruction of
  `vector'[r][s][t]` (§7.6.3.1, PMV state machine, wrap-around) stays
  out of scope.
  - Table B-10 `motion_code`: all 33 codewords (`-16..=+16`) walked
    MSB-first longest-first, 1-/3-/4-/5-/7-/8-/10-/11-bit groups,
    prefix-free.
  - Table B-11 `dmvector[t]`: the 1-/2-bit `{0, +1, -1}` VLC.
  - Fixed-length `motion_residual[r][s][t]` read iff `f_code != 1 &&
    motion_code != 0`, width `r_size = f_code - 1` (1..=8 bits);
    `f_code` outside §6.3.11's `1..=9` range rejected when a residual
    would otherwise drive the cursor.
  - `motion_vertical_field_select[r][s]` flag honoured per §6.2.5.2 —
    suppressed when `motion_vector_count == 1 && (mv_format == frame
    || dmv == 1)`, present otherwise (both rows when count == 2).
  - Typed `MotionVector`, `MotionVectorEntry`, `MotionVectors`,
    `MotionVectorsContext`, `MotionVectorsKind` (re-exported at the
    crate root). `MotionVectors::parse(br, kind, &MotionType, &ctx)`
    threads a parsed `frame_motion_type` / `field_motion_type` (round
    10) and the `f_code[s][t]` matrix straight through.
- 29 new unit tests covering every Table B-10 row (parsed
  individually), the +16 / -16 extremes, the 33-unique-values
  invariant, prefix-freeness and width-fitting, unknown-prefix /
  truncated-buffer rejection on both VLC tables, Table B-11's three
  values plus its truncated-second-bit short case, the
  `motion_vector(r, s)` presence-matrix (no residual on f_code = 1 or
  motion_code = 0, residual width = `f_code - 1`, dmvector suppressed
  when `dmv = 0`), out-of-range `f_code` rejection, all four
  `motion_vectors(s)` shapes (frame count-1 / field count-1 /
  dual-prime count-1 / count-2), the Forward / Backward `f_code` pair
  selection, `motion_vector_count` validation, and truncated-VFS-/
  truncated-motion-code short paths.
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: the first I-picture is plain `Intra` so per §6.2.5.2 no
  `motion_vectors()` element exists (the fixture's f_codes are pinned
  to the §6.3.11 "unused" sentinel `15`), and a spliced P-picture
  frame macroblock prefix that drives the full `macroblock_type` →
  `frame_motion_type` → `dct_type` → `motion_vectors(0)` chain
  (`motion_code = -1`, `motion_residual = 1` with `f_code = 2`,
  `motion_code_vert = 0`) and asserts the 9-bit total cursor
  accounting.

- Clean-room rebuild round 12: motion-vector reconstruction per
  ISO/IEC 13818-2 (Recommendation ITU-T H.262) §7.6.3.1 plus
  §7.6.3.4 reset rules and §7.6.3.7 chroma scaling. The bridge from
  round 11's parsed `motion_code` / `motion_residual` / `dmvector`
  fields to the spec's `vector'[r][s][t]` reconstructed luminance
  motion vector.
  - `compute_delta(motion_code, motion_residual, f_code)` derives
    `delta` per the spec formula (`f = 1 << (f_code - 1)`, shortcut
    `delta = motion_code` when `f == 1 || motion_code == 0`,
    otherwise `sign(motion_code) * ((|motion_code| - 1) * f +
    motion_residual + 1)`).
  - `vector_range(f_code)` returns `(low, high, range) =
    (-16*f, 16*f - 1, 32*f)`. Doubles per Table 7-8 entry across
    `f_code ∈ {1..=9}`; out-of-range `f_code` rejected.
  - `reconstruct_component(motion_code, motion_residual, f_code,
    prior_pmv, mv_format, picture_structure, t)` runs the §7.6.3.1
    procedure for one component: half-pred for the
    `(mv_format == field && t == vertical && picture_structure ==
    frame)` case using §4.3 floor-division (`div_euclid`), `vector' =
    prediction + delta`, wrap into `[low, high]` via `± range`, and
    `new_pmv = vector' * 2` for the half-pred case else `vector'`.
    Bitstream conformance per §7.6.3.2 (`delta`, `vector'`, new PMV
    all in range) enforced as a parse-time invariant.
  - `reconstruct_motion_vector(pmv, &MotionVector, r, s, f_code_h,
    f_code_v, mv_format, picture_structure)` chains the two
    components and writes the new PMVs back into the supplied
    `Pmv` slot.
  - `Pmv { values: [[[i32; 2]; 2]; 2] }` carries the four
    `PMV[r][s][t]` predictors in half-sample units (Table 7-7) with
    `Pmv::get` / `set` typed by `VectorIndex` / `Direction` /
    `Component`. `Pmv::reset()` for §7.6.3.4 (slice start /
    non-concealment intra / P-picture non-intra without forward /
    P-skipped). `Pmv::default()` and `Pmv::new()` zero every slot.
  - `scale_chroma(luma_horiz, luma_vert, ChromaFormat) ->
    ScaledMotionVector` per §7.6.3.7: 4:2:0 halves both components,
    4:2:2 halves only horizontal, 4:4:4 is identity. Toward-zero
    integer division per §4.3.
  - Typed `Pmv`, `ReconstructedComponent { vector_prime, new_pmv,
    delta, range }`, `ScaledMotionVector { luma_horiz, luma_vert,
    chroma_horiz, chroma_vert }`, `Component { Horizontal,
    Vertical }`, `Direction { Forward, Backward }`,
    `VectorIndex { First, Second }` (re-exported at the crate root).
- 29 new unit tests covering: `compute_delta`'s shortcut and
  full-formula branches across `f_code ∈ {1..=9}` and motion-code
  signs, `motion_residual` presence-required / presence-forbidden
  rejection, out-of-range `f_code` rejection (0, 10, 15),
  `vector_range` invariants (f_code=1 ⇒ ±16, f_code=9 ⇒ ±4096,
  range doubles per step), end-to-end `reconstruct_motion_vector`
  with no-wrap / wrap-low / wrap-high paths, vertical-half-pred
  matrix (frame vs field picture, horizontal vs vertical component),
  floor-division for negative PMV under half-pred, PMV slot
  independence for `(r = 0 vs r = 1)` and `(forward vs backward)`,
  delta-outside-range rejection, `Pmv::default` / `Pmv::reset` zero
  every slot, chroma scaling for all three `ChromaFormat` values
  plus toward-zero rounding on negative odd inputs, and Table 7-7
  index enums.
- 2 new black-box integration tests against the existing 352×240
  fixture: confirms the fixture's I-picture is the §7.6.3 "PMV
  unused" case (every f_code is the `15` sentinel; PMV stays zero
  after the §7.6.3.4 reset), and a spliced two-macroblock
  P-picture chain (`motion_code = +2, residual = 0` then
  `motion_code = -1, residual = 0`, both with `f_code = 2`)
  decodes through `MotionVector → reconstruct_motion_vector`
  with PMV state evolving from `0 → 3 → 2` (second `delta = -1`
  added on top of the first vector's predictor `PMV = 3`), and the
  4:2:0 chroma scaling halves both components.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-18** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.0.11`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.

### Next

- `quant_matrix_extension()` (§6.2.3.2),
  `picture_display_extension()` (§6.2.3.3),
  `sequence_display_extension()` (§6.2.2.4),
  `sequence_scalable_extension()` (§6.2.2.5).
- Composite-display sub-fields (`v_axis` / `field_sequence` /
  `sub_carrier` / `burst_amplitude` / `sub_carrier_phase`) inside
  `picture_coding_extension()` when `composite_display_flag` is 1.
- §7.6.3.3 inter-vector PMV-copy table (Tables 7-9 / 7-10) — the
  macroblock-loop driver's responsibility once that lands.
- §7.6.3.6 dual-prime additional arithmetic (deriving the
  opposite-parity vector from the decoded forward vector).
- §7.6.3.9 concealment motion vectors.
- Residual block VLC tables (B-12 .. B-16) plus IDCT and motion
  compensation.
- The scalable `macroblock_type` Tables B-5 .. B-8 once
  `sequence_scalable_extension()` parsing lands.
- `oxideav_core::Decoder` wiring once a complete picture round-trips.
