//! MPEG-2 §6.2.4 slice-level macroblock-header walker per
//! **ISO/IEC 13818-2 (ITU-T H.262)**.
//!
//! The §6.2.4 slice body is a `do { macroblock() } while
//! ( nextbits() != '0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000' )` loop that the
//! crate already parses *piecewise* through the header bits
//! ([`crate::SliceHeader`]) and the per-macroblock parsers
//! ([`crate::MbAddressIncrement`], [`crate::MacroblockType`],
//! [`crate::QuantizerScale`], [`crate::MacroblockModesTail`], …).
//! This module composes those parsers into the §6.2.4 loop itself:
//! the per-slice driver that picks up at
//! [`crate::SliceHeader::body_bit_position`] and walks macroblock
//! after macroblock until the §5.2.3 / §6.2.4 stop condition is met.
//!
//! ## What this driver delivers
//!
//! The slice driver folds the §6.2.5 / §6.2.5.1 macroblock-header
//! **and `macroblock_modes()` tail** into a single per-slice walk
//! over the parsers already in this crate:
//!
//! 1. **§6.2.5** `macroblock_address_increment` (Table B-1 VLC with
//!    `macroblock_escape` chains).
//! 2. **§6.2.5.1** `macroblock_modes()`:
//!     * opener — `macroblock_type` VLC (Tables B-2 / B-3 / B-4)
//!       decoded against the picture coding type;
//!     * tail — `frame_motion_type` (Table 6-17) in frame pictures
//!       with `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0`, `field_motion_type`
//!       (Table 6-18) in field pictures, both gated on
//!       `macroblock_motion_forward || macroblock_motion_backward`;
//!     * tail — `dct_type` in frame pictures with
//!       `frame_pred_frame_dct == 0` whose MB is intra or has a
//!       coded pattern.
//! 3. **§6.2.5** macroblock-level `quantiser_scale_code` (5 bits, in
//!    `1..=31`) when `macroblock_quant == 1`, read *after* the
//!    `macroblock_modes()` block per the §6.2.5 syntax tree.
//!
//! The remainder of `macroblock()` — `motion_vectors(s)`, the
//! `marker_bit` when intra concealment vectors are present,
//! `coded_block_pattern()`, and the per-block walker — is still
//! out of scope at the slice-walker layer: those parsers need the
//! per-picture PMV state, the `f_code[][]` matrix from
//! `picture_coding_extension()`, and the §7.6.3.4 reset semantics
//! that bind to the picture-level driver above this one. The
//! [`MacroblockRecord::body_bit_position`] cursor is the entry
//! point those rounds will resume from.
//!
//! ## What §6.2.4 / §6.3.17.1 say
//!
//! Page 51 of ISO/IEC 13818-2:1995 gives the slice body:
//!
//! ```text
//! slice() {
//!     slice_start_code
//!     ... slice-header bits ...
//!     do {
//!         macroblock()
//!     } while ( nextbits() != '0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000' )
//!     next_start_code()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Per §5.2.3 / §6.2.4 the stop condition is "the next 23 bits, if
//! they were read, would all be zero" — i.e. the byte-aligned
//! `next_start_code()` prefix `0x000001` is one bit-shift away. In
//! practice every legal MPEG-2 slice ends on a byte boundary with
//! the bytes `0x00 0x00 0x01 <next start code>` immediately
//! following the last bit of the last macroblock, with optional
//! zero-byte stuffing in between (§5.2.3).
//!
//! §6.3.17.1 gives the per-slice state the driver maintains:
//!
//! * `previous_macroblock_address` is `mb_row * mb_width - 1` at the
//!   start of the slice (the macroblock immediately before the first
//!   macroblock of the slice). In this driver the caller passes
//!   `mb_row * mb_width - 1` in through [`SliceWalkContext`].
//! * `macroblock_address = previous_macroblock_address +
//!   macroblock_address_increment` per macroblock.
//! * Any macroblocks at addresses `previous_macroblock_address + 1
//!   .. macroblock_address - 1` are **skipped** macroblocks (§6.3.17.4
//!   §7.6.6). The §7.6.6 skipped-MB reconstruction is not run here;
//!   the driver merely records the skipped-MB index ranges so the
//!   higher-layer (§7.6.6) round can dispatch.
//! * `past_intra_address` is `-2` at the start of the picture and set
//!   to `macroblock_address` after every intra macroblock. The driver
//!   tracks it across macroblocks within a single slice; carrying it
//!   *across* slices is the picture-level driver's job.
//! * `quantiser_scale_code` is set from `slice_header()` initially
//!   and overwritten in any macroblock that has `macroblock_quant == 1`.
//!
//! Macroblocks at the **start of a slice** shall have
//! `macroblock_address_increment == 1` (§6.3.17.1). The driver
//! enforces this on the first macroblock and rejects any other
//! value.
//!
//! ## Why the remaining body fields are deferred
//!
//! Each remaining post-`macroblock_modes()` field comes with
//! cross-macroblock state that this driver alone cannot satisfy:
//!
//! * `motion_vectors(s)` needs the per-slice §7.6.3.4 PMV reset on
//!   intra macroblocks, the `f_code` array from
//!   `picture_coding_extension()`, and the §7.6.3.1 reconstruction
//!   call to actually use the parsed vectors. The reconstruction
//!   itself is in [`crate::pmv`]; bolting it onto this driver before
//!   we have a picture-level driver above would force a circular
//!   "slice driver knows picture state" coupling.
//! * The `marker_bit` after `motion_vectors(1)` is gated on
//!   `macroblock_intra && concealment_motion_vectors`; the
//!   concealment-MV path *itself* reads `motion_vectors(0)` even
//!   for an intra macroblock, so the marker_bit read has to follow
//!   that path landing.
//! * `coded_block_pattern()` is a small parser but the §6.3.17.4
//!   `pattern_code[12]` derivation it feeds is consumed by the
//!   §6.2.6 `block(i)` driver — already landed in
//!   [`crate::mpeg2_block_decoder`] — and the per-block walker
//!   [`crate::mpeg2_macroblock_blocks`]. Wiring those together
//!   requires the per-block `BlockContext` plus the §7.4.2.1
//!   weighting matrices, which today come from the sequence
//!   extension rather than the slice driver.
//!
//! These will land progressively in follow-on rounds; this driver
//! exposes per-macroblock [`MacroblockRecord::body_bit_position`] so
//! each upcoming round can resume parsing at the post-`macroblock_modes()`
//! cursor.
//!
//! ## What this module provides
//!
//! * [`SliceWalkContext`] — the per-picture / per-slice constants
//!   the driver needs (mb_width, picture_coding_type, mpeg1-vs-mpeg2
//!   address-increment context, initial quantiser_scale_code,
//!   plus the §6.3.11 `picture_structure` and `frame_pred_frame_dct`
//!   that gate the §6.2.5.1 `macroblock_modes()` tail).
//! * [`MacroblockRecord`] — the per-macroblock summary the walker
//!   emits, including the parsed `motion_type` and `dct_type` from
//!   `macroblock_modes()`.
//! * [`SliceWalk`] — the per-slice summary: the [`MacroblockRecord`]
//!   list, the final `previous_macroblock_address` /
//!   `past_intra_address`, and the bit position right after the last
//!   macroblock-header field (the entry point for the deferred body
//!   parsers above).
//! * [`walk_slice`] — the driver entry point.
//!
//! Spec citations refer to **ISO/IEC 13818-2:1995** (Recommendation
//! ITU-T H.262 (1995 E)) §5.2.3 (`next_start_code`), §6.2.4
//! (`slice()`), §6.2.5 / §6.2.5.1 (`macroblock()` /
//! `macroblock_modes()` — Tables 6-17 / 6-18 / 6-19 for the
//! motion-type / dct_type defaults), §6.3.11 (Table 6-14
//! `picture_structure` and `frame_pred_frame_dct`), §6.3.17.1
//! (slice-state semantics).
